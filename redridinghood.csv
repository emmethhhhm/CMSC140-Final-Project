2084,413,The Stolen Clothing (previously Marriage by Stealing Clothing),"A youth comes upon a holy man (old woman) in the forest [N825]. He is told not to go in a certain direction, but when he does so [Z211], he sees three beautiful maidens bathing. The holy man agrees to help him, turns him into a bird, tells him to steal the clothes of one of the bathing girls [K1335], and warns him not to look back under any circumstances [C311]. The first time he does look back and is burned to a pile of ashes. The holy man restores him [E121.5], and the youth succeeds on his second attempt. Cf. Types 400, 408."
2085,300,The Dragon-Slayer,"A youth acquires (e.g. by exchange) three wonderful dogs [B421, B312.2]. He comes to a town where people are mourning and learns that once a year a (seven-headed) dragon [B11.2.3.1] demands a virgin as a sacrifice [B11.10, S262]. In the current year, the kings daughter has been chosen to be sacrificed, and the king offers her as a prize to her rescuer [T68.1]. The youth goes to the appointed place. While waiting to fight with the dragon, he falls into a magic sleep [D1975], during which the princess twists a ring (ribbons) into his hair; only one of her falling tears can awaken him [D1978.2]. Together with his dogs, the youth overcomes the dragon [B11.11, B524.1.1, R111.1.3]. He strikes off the dragons heads and cuts out the tongues (keeps the teeth) [H105.1]. The youth promises the princess to come back in one year (three years) and goes off. An impostor (e.g. the coachman) takes the dragons heads, forces the princess to name him as her rescuer [K1933], and claims her as his reward [K1932]. The princess asks her father to delay the wedding. Just as the princess is about to marry the impostor, the dragon-slayer returns. He sends his dogs to get some food from the kings table and is summoned to the wedding party [H151.2]. There the dragon-slayer proves he was the rescuer by showing the dragons tongues (teeth) [H83, H105.1]. The impostor is condemned to death, and the dragon-slayer marries the princess. Cf. Types 301, 303, 314, 315, 502, 530, 554."
2086,300A,The Fight on the Bridge,"(Including the previous Type 300A*.) After having eaten a (three) fish, the daughter of a tsar, her maid, and a she-dog (cow, mare, cat) give birth to sons at the same time [T511.5.1]. (Cf. Type 303.) The three sons together go out for adventure [F601]. While his brothers are sleeping, the animal son [B631] (often a fool) fights against a three-headed dragon [B11.2.3.2] on a bridge. In the following two nights he defeats six- [B11.2.3.3], twelve- [B11.2.3.5] or multi-headed [B11.2.3, B11.11] dragons (is able to defeat the third one only with the help of his horse [B401]). (In the form of a fly [D185.3], cat [D142] or the like), the animal son overhears the conversations of the dragon-wives (dragon-daughters) [N451], defeats their enchantments, and thus saves his brothers. The dragons mother pursues the three brothers and devours two of them [B11.10.3]. The animal son hides in a magic forge. He outwits the dragons mother, who spits out the brothers she had devoured. Together with the smiths, the animal son kills the dragons mother, and the smiths forge her to a horse. Cf. Type 705A. In some cases, a magical old man (father of the slain dragons) defeats the animal son in a contest (horse race) and takes away his horse. The old man sends out a hero in order to win a bride (often a transition to Type 513A). In addition to this regular form, there exist two versions without the introductory part of the magic conception: (1) The dragon-slayer wins back the celestial lights which the dragon had stolen and gives them to men. (Previously Type 300A*.) Cf. Type 328A*. (2) The animal son defeats the strongest dragon and wins his horse for the tsar."
2087,301,The Three Stolen Princesses,"(Including the previous Types 301A and 301B.) This type combines various introductory episodes with a common main part: Introductory episodes: (1) A king banishes his three daughters to the underworld (they are abducted by monsters [H1385.1]). Three brothers (a supernatural hero with his extraordinary companions) go to find the daughters. (2) A monster (dragon, snake, etc.)steals golden apples from the kings garden. Three brothers (princes) lie in wait. Only the youngest is able to wound the monster. The brothers follow his bloody tracks [F102.1, N773]. (3) A child of magic birth (son of a bear or horse [B631], born from tears) grows into a youth gifted with exceptional strength [T615]. He takes to the road for adventure (luck), and allies himself with two companions with extraordinary powers [F601]. When they prepare their food, twice a little man (dwarf, devil, giant) spoils it (eats the food and beats up the cook) [F451.5.2]. Only the hero is able to catch and punish the little man, who then shows the companions the entrance to the underworld. Main part: The companions (brothers) come to a well (pit, cave) [F92] and lower the hero (youngest brother) into it [F96]. The hero overcomes monsters (dragons, devils) and rescues (the three) princesses (with the princesses help, using a weapon, only by his strength, by magic means) [R111.2.1]. (The princesses give him presents.) His treacherous companions pull the princesses up but leave the hero below [K1931.2] (cut off the rope [K963], overturn the basket). They force the maidens to name them as their rescuers [K1933]. The hero returns to the upper world with the help of a spirit, which gives him the ability to fly (a bird to whom he has to feed his own flesh [B322.1]; he ascends on a climbing plant which he himself planted, etc.). The princesses delay their wedding (for a year). On the wedding day, the hero comes to the castle and is imprisoned. But the truth comes to light (the hero is recognized by the princesses when he shows the presents [H80]), and the impostors are punished (banished, killed) [Q262]. The hero marries the youngest princess [L161] and becomes king. Cf. Type 300. In some variants, the hero has to go to much deeper regions of the underworld before he is able to come back to the upper world, because he mistakenly mounted a black animal (ram, sheep, goat, horse, lion, snake) instead of a white one. Finally the white animal carries him up again."
2088,301D*,The Princesss Ring (previously Dragons Ravish Princesses),"When she goes for a walk, a princess (daughter of a tsar) disappears. Her father promises her to whoever finds and rescues her [T68.1]. A soldier takes a ship and goes out to search for the princess. On a lonely island he meets a dragon (giant, devil), makes him drunk with wine, cuts off his head and takes away his keys [B11.11]. He finds the princess and takes her to the ship. Just when they are about to sail, the princess asks for a ring she forgot, and the soldier goes back to get it. Meanwhile the ship sails away and the treacherous captain forces the princess to name him as her rescuer [K1933]. The soldier takes service with robbers (devils, magician) and finds magic objects in a forbidden room of their house [C611] (castle) (gets them as payment). With the help of these objects he gets back home. On her wedding day with the captain, the princess recognizes the soldier by her ring [H94], tells her father the truth, and marries the soldier [L161]. Cf. Types 301, 505."
2089,302,The Ogres (Devils) Heart in the Egg,"(Including the previous Types 302A*, 302B*, and 425P.) Because he helped some animals to divide a meal in a fair manner, a youth is rewarded with the ability to transform himself into their shapes (they promise their help because he spared or nourished them) [B393, B500, D1834]; cf. Type 554. He goes to rescue a princess who has been abducted by an ogre (giant, dragon, devil) (to rescue his wife who has been abducted by a supernatural enemy, cf. Type 400) [R11.1]. As an eagle, the youth comes to the ogres castle, as an ant into the princesss chamber [D152.2, D182.2]. He learns from the princess that the ogre cannot be defeated because his heart (power of life, soul) is hidden outside of his body [E710]. The princess elicits the hiding place from the ogre [K975.2]: His heart lies enclosed in various animals in an egg (little box) [E711.1, E713]; cf. Type 590. The youth follows the princesss instructions, finds the ogres soul, and destroys it (the grateful animals do so for him [B571.1]). The ogre dies [K956], and the youth marries the princess [L161]. Cf. Type 665."
2090,302B,Life Dependent on a Sword (previously Hero with Life Dependent on his Sword),"(Including the previous Type 516B.) A childless couple magically conceive a son [T510]. An old man (his father, God) gives the son a sword (knife) which he should always carry with him (should not lay it on the ground, not pull out from its sheath). Or: The youngest of three brothers inherits a horse, clothes, and a sabre from his father, and goes out for adventure, accompanied by some companions (blood-brothers) with magic powers [F601]. With the aid of his sword he defeats the kings army and kills a dragon(s). His companions marry the rescued women. The youth himself marries a woman of extraordinary beauty. When the king catches a sight of her picture [T11.2] or of a curl (ring, slipper) which she lost in the sea (river), he falls in love with her and sends out an old woman (witch) to capture her. By a trick the old woman enters the youths house, learns the secret of the sword [E711.10], and throws it into the sea. Deprived of his strength, the youth dies, and his wife is taken to the king. Through a life token, the youths friends discover what has happened, recover the sword, restore it to its original condition, and resuscitate the youth. The youth creeps into the kings castle, hides in the room of his wife, kills the king (the old woman), and becomes king himself. Cf. Type 318."
2091,302C*,The Magic Horse,"(Including the previous Type 422*.) At the wish of the dead king, his youngest son permits his three sisters to marry the first suitors who come for them. Visiting his brothers-in-law, he learns that they are the masters of the three kingdoms of animals. The prince wins a wife who forbids him to enter a certain room [C611]. He disregards her prohibition and revives a dragon (demon) who is impaled on a wall (contained in a hoop). The dragon frees himself and abducts the princes wife. The prince searches for her and three times tries to flee with her. Riding on his magic horse, the dragon overtakes the two but does not kill the prince, because he promised to spare his life three times; the fourth time, he cuts him up. Signals of distress tell the brothers-in-law that the prince is in danger, and they come and resuscitate him. He goes back to the dragon, asks his wife to find out where the magic horse came from, and learns that a certain witch owns one. On his way to the witch, the prince wins the gratitude of three animals which help him to tend the witchs three horses (daughters) that live in the earth, the clouds, and the sea. In payment, the prince choses a scabby foal which turns into a magic horse (with extra legs), and he and his wife flee on his back. The magic horse is the brother of the dragons horse, and it compells the latter to throw off its rider, the dragon. The dragon is killed, and the prince returns home together with his wife. Cf. Type 552."
2092,303,The Twins or Blood-Brothers,"(Including the previous Types 553 and 581.) After having eaten a magic fish (apple, water) [T511.5.1, T511.1.1, T512], a woman gives birth to twins. (Cf. Type 705A.) Grateful animals accompany the grown-up brothers, or animals give them one or more of their young ones because the brothers did not kill them. (The brothers are given unusual animals; they win them or bring them up; in some variants, the animals are born at the same time as the brothers [T589.7.1].) Together with his animals, one of the brothers sets out. When the brothers separate, they agree upon a life token that gives a warning when one of them is in mortal danger and needs help: Water will become cloudy, a plant or a tree dry up, a knife stuck in a tree will grow rusty, etc. [E761]. The first brother frees a princess (three princesses) from a dragon (trolls), unmasks an impostor (Red Knight) who pretended to be the princesss rescuer, and marries the princess [R111.1.3, K1932, H83, L161]. Cf. Type 300. Against a warning, the hero follows a light [G451] (is tempted by an animal). He falls into the power of a witch and is turned to stone [D231]. His twin brother is warned by the life token and sets forth in quest of him. The princess mistakes him for her husband, as the two brothers are very much alike [K1311.1]. At night the brother puts a naked sword in the bed between himself and his sister-in-law [T351]. Then he finds the witch, makes her remove the spell from his brother, and kills her. The first brother learns that the second has slept with his wife and kills him out of jealousy [N342.3]. Later on, when he asks his wife why she had put the sword in the bed, he realizes that his brother was innocent. The brother is resuscitated by magic means [B512] (water of life). In some variants, a youth saves the life of a raven (crane, eagle). As a reward he obtains magic objects. The youth defeats a sea monster, delivers three princesses, and marries the youngest of them. (Previously Type 553.)"
2093,303A,Brothers Seek Sisters as Wives (previously Six Brothers Seek Seven Sisters as Wives),"A number of brothers (usually six, twelve or one hundred) set out to find a number of sisters as wives for themselves and their youngest brother who remained home [T69.1]. On the way an old man (giant, troll) transforms the brothers and their brides into stone and takes the youngest bride for himself [D231, R11.1]. The youngest brother goes to look for his lost brothers and comes to the old mans house. Here he finds the youngest bride who tells him that the heart (life) of the old man is enclosed in a bird [E715.1]. With the help of grateful animals which he had fed on his way, the youngest brother catches the bird and kills it, thus killing the old man (he rescues his brothers and the brides by performing different tasks). Brothers and brides are restored to life [R155.1]. Cf. Type 302. In some variants, the brothers marry the daughters of a witch. During the night in bed the brothers exchange their places with those of their wives. The witch kills her own daughters. Cf. Type 1119."
2094,304,The Dangerous Night-Watch (previously The Hunter),"Together with his brothers (companions), a youth (youngest of three brothers, hunter, prince, soldier, etc.)has various hunting adventures, or he defeats dragons (wild animals, monsters) during one (three) night-watch(es) in the forest (at his fathers grave). While the youth fights, his fire (light) goes out (the youth loses his way, is tempted away by a bird). He (stops time and) meets giants (robbers, supernatural beings) whom he impresses by shooting tricks [F666.1] or by his extraordinary physical strength. The giants go to plunder a castle (town) or to carry off a princess, and take the youth with them. The youth shoots a watchdog (rooster), enters the castle first, calls the giants and, as they enter, he cuts off their heads one at a time [K912]. Often he cuts off their tongues (heads, other parts of the body) which he takes away as trophies [H83]. Cf. Type 300. In the castle, the youth comes to a room where a princess lies sleeping [N711.2]. He looks at her (falls in love, kisses her, rapes her) and, before leaving, takes a souvenir (jewelry, handkerchief, shoes, etc.)which later becomes a token [H81.1, H81.1.1, T475.2]; cf. Types 301, 301D*. Then he returns with a burning log (lets time resume) and kindles the fire again. An impostor pretends that he had killed the giants and claims the (pregnant) princess for his wife. The princess refuses to marry him. She sets up (is made to live in) an inn [Q481] where guests need not pay anything if they tell a tale (life-history, news). (Accompanied by his brothers and mother,) the youth stops at this inn, proves his identity by means of his tale and the tokens, and marries the princess [H11.1.1, H81, L161]. The impostor is punished."
2095,305,The Dragons Heart-blood as Remedy [D1500,"1.7.3.3]. This tale exists chiefly in four different forms (cf. Types 314, 551, 673): (1) A king falls ill and learns that he can only be cured by the milk and blood of a dragons heart. He promises his oldest daughter to whoever is able to get the remedy, and his youngest daughter to whoever assists. A nobleman and a farmer boy set out and, with the help of an old woman, arrive at the dragons forest. The farmer boy kills the dragon, squeezes milk and blood out of its heart, and hides them. Threatening to kill him, the nobleman takes the dragons heart, presents it to the king and wins the eldest daughter and the kingdom [K1935]. The farmer boy and the youngest daughter are sent to live in the goose house. Because there were neither milk nor blood in the dragons heart, the nobleman, the farmer boy, and the old woman are questioned. Truth comes to light, and the kingdom goes to the farmer boy. (2) During his travels, a workman learns that the sick king can only be cured by a dragons liver. He sees the dragons vulnerable spot in a dream. He kills the dragon and boasts of his victory in an inn. The host steals the mans knapsack which, however, contains only a stone. The workman arrives at the kings court prior to the host, cures the king, and wins the princess as his wife. The thievish host is hanged. (3) A father orders his son to bring him the devils tongue to cure his illness, but the son cannot find the devil. An old man advises him to knock with a stick on a certain trunk. A horse appears and carries him to the devil. The horse gives the son a piece of his hoof which he can use to call it whenever he is in danger. The son challenges the devil, but, during the fight, the devil thrusts him into the earth up to his waist. With the help of the horse, the son defeats the devil, brings the devils tongue to his father, and thus cures him. (4) While hunting, a prince is bewitched and loses his voice. A young woman appears in his dream and tells him about a remedy: a medicine consisting of dragons eyes, a dragons heart and other ingredients, which must be prepared in a certain manner. In return the young woman demands that the prince marry her. After the prince agrees, a youth appears and produces the medicine in the prescribed way. The cure is successful, and the prince marries the young woman."
2096,306,The Danced-out Shoes,"(Including the previous Type 306A.) Every day, a princess(es) wears out a pair of shoes. Her father wants to know why and offers the princess (one of the princesses) to whoever discovers the secret [H508.2]. Anyone who fails will lose his head. A youth (soldier, Gypsy, tailor, shepherd, farmer, etc.)acquires a magic object (e.g. shoes, cap, overcoat, stick) which makes him invisible [D1980]. He refuses a narcotic drink and does not fall asleep [K625.1]. After making himself invisible, the youth accompanies the princess on a magical underground journey [D2131]. In the underworld he watches the princess wear out her shoes by dancing with the devil (dragon, other supernatural beings) [F1015.1.1]. The next morning the youth tells the king what happened and corroborates his tale by tokens (e.g. twigs, apples, ring, piece of the princesss garment) from the underworld [H80]. He marries the princess [L161] and becomes king. Cf. Type 507A. Mainly in Indian variants, a prince accompanies his wife to the otherworld where she has to dance each night before a divinity. He frees her [F87]. (Previously Type 306A.)"
2097,307,The Princess in the Coffin (previously The Princess in the Shroud),"(Including the previous Types 307B* and 307C*.) After a hasty wish (curse), a diabolic (black, mute) daughter is born to a childless couple (king and queen) [C758.1, S223]. The daughter demands that when she dies, there should be a night-watch at her coffin in the church (graveyard) (someone should watch over her for three nights in order to save her). The dead girl rises every night from the coffin and swallows the man on guard [E251]. A soldier (boy) learns from an old man what he must do to free the girl from the witchcraft [N825.2]. During the first two nights, he hides from the dead girl. During the third night, when the girl leaves the coffin, the soldier lies down in it, refuses to let her in, and forces her (by means of a rusty sword) to say a paternoster (sing a hymn at the altar). As she says the prayer, the rooster crows and the girl is disenchanted [D791.1.7]. The guards are revived and the girl marries her rescuer [L162]. (The soldier tears his bride into two parts and shakes out the bad spirit in the form of reptiles.) Various other magic or religious means can be used to save the princess."
2098,310,The Maiden in the Tower,"(Petrosinella, Rapunzel.) A (pregnant) woman steals herbs (fruits) from the garden of a witch (sorceress) [G279.2] and is forced to promise her unborn child to the witch [S222.1]. The woman bears a girl, and after a certain time the witch comes for the daughter (often called Petrosinella, Rapunzel, etc. according to the name of the stolen plant) [G204]. The witch locks her up in a tower [R41.2]. Whenever the witch wants to visit her, she enters by climbing on the girls long (golden) hair as on a ladder [F848.1]. A prince discovers the girl in the tower because of her hair shining in the sun [F555] and falls in love with her. The girl gives the witch a sleeping-draught. The prince climbs up on the girls hair and they have a love affair. The witch finds out about the nocturnal visits of the prince. She wants to prevent further visits, but accidentally discloses that the lovers could flee by transforming themselves with the help of three oak galls. The girl overhears the conversation [N455] and explains the magic oak galls to the prince. They flee together and are pursued by the witch. They escape [D642.7] and the witch is killed. The prince marries the girl [L162]."
2099,311,Rescue by the Sister,"Two sisters, one after the other, fall into power of a demonic suitor (cannibal, dragon, magician, devil) and are taken into his (subterranean) castle [R11.1, T721.5]. There the sisters open a forbidden room full of dead bodies, in the course of which the key (a magic egg, apple) becomes bloody, or they refuse to eat human flesh [C611, C227, C913]. The demon kills them for their disobedience [C920]. Using a trick, the third (youngest) sister escapes from the same fate. She finds her sisters and resuscitates them by putting their bones together [R157.1]. She hides them beneath some gold in baskets (bags) and persuades the demon to carry the baskets home without looking into them [G561]. Cf. Type 1132. The youngest sister pretends to marry the demon and leaves a skull (straw dummy) dressed as a bride to deceive him. Unwittingly the demon carries this sister home in the third basket. Or she smears herself with honey and feathers and escapes as a strange bird [K525, K521.1]. Cf. Types 1383, 1681. The demon is burned in his own house or is killed in another way [Q211]. Cf. Type 312."
2100,311B*,The Singing Bag,"A Gypsy (old man) puts the niece of an old washerwoman (only daughter of an old couple) into a bag and carries her off. The Gypsy goes begging from door to door and exhibits his singing bag: He gives the bag a pinch, threatens to beat it with his stick, and orders it to sing. Thereupon the girl in the bag starts singing her tale: I left my rosary on a stone by the river when I was washing. When I wanted to get it, a Gypsy put me in his bag and carried me off. (I am the only daughter of an old couple. An old man carried me off when I was gathering berries in the forest.) One day the Gypsy arrives at the old washerwomans house. The woman recognizes her niece, invites the Gypsy into his house, and entertains him until he gets drunk. When he is sleeping, she rescues the girl from the bag and, in her place, puts two cats (horse-dung). When the Gypsy exhibits his singing bag the next time, the cats mew. The Gypsy opens the bag and is scratched or bitten [K526]."
2101,312,Maiden-killer (Bluebeard) (previously The Giant-killer and his Dog),"An odd-looking rich man (e.g. with a blue beard [S62.1]) takes his bride to his splendid castle. She is forbidden to open a certain room, but she disobeys and finds it full of the dead bodies of her predecessors [C611]. The husband wants to kill her for her disobedience [C920], but she is able to delay the punishment (three times) [K551]. She (her sister) calls their brother (three brothers) who kills the husband (sometimes with help from a dog or other animal) and rescues his sister(s) [G551.1, G652]. Cf. Type 311."
2102,312A,The Rescued Girl (previously The Brother Rescues His Sister from the Tiger),"A man gives his daughter in marriage to a tiger (monkey, supernatural being) because he made a rash vow (as a payment for the tigers help, or because the tiger threatened him). The tiger eats the girl and demands her sister(s), whom he also eats. The youngest sister (brother) kills the tiger (the girl escapes and the tiger is lured back to the village and killed)."
2103,312C,The Rescued Bride (previously Devils Bride Rescued by Brother),"(Including the previous Type 452A*.) (A man promises his daughter to the devil.) The girl marries the devil (Or: A youth curses his sister: The devil may take her. This happens.) The brother searches for his sister, finds her and rescues her (frequently with the help of his dogs)."
2104,312D,Rescue by the Brother (previously Brother Saves his Sister and Brothers from the Dragon),"(Peas Son.) A dragon (devil) carries off a girl (three girls) and kills her brothers when they try to rescue her. After a magic conception (often by swallowing a pea [T511.3]), the mother of the siblings gives birth to a strong son [F611.1]. This son kills the dragon, rescues his sister, and resuscitates his brothers. The envious brothers plan to kill the youngest. But because of his strength he is able to free himself and to punish his brothers. Cf. Type 550."
2105,313,The Magic Flight,"(Including the previous Types 313A, 313B, 313C, and 313H*.) This type combines various introductory episodes with the two main parts of the Magic Flight and the Forgotten Fiance. Introductory episodes: (1) After a war between birds and quadrupeds [B261, cf. Type 222], a wounded eagle is cared for by a man. The eagle (its relatives) gives the man a box which he must not open before he arrives at home. The man disobeys and a castle appears. An giant helps the man close the box and, in return, is promised the mans unborn son [S222]. Cf. Type 537. In some variants, a boy is promised to a demon, giant, or devil [S222, S240], or the boy promises himself to the demon. Threatening him with death, the demon (giant, devil) assigns the youth (often three) impossible tasks [G465] (e.g. building a castle in one night [H1104], bailing out a pond with a sieve [H1113], felling a forest using an axe of glass, capturing a magic horse [H1154.8]) which he performs with the help of the demons daughter [H335.0.1]. Before the youth can marry the daughter, he must identify her in a group of women (her sisters) who look just like her. (2) A youth watches girls (transformed swans) bathing in a lake and steals the swan dress of one of them [D361.1, D721]. The girl agrees to marry the youth and takes him to her fathers house. Cf. Types 400, 465A. (3) A king suffering from leprosy (scabs) captures a prince and feeds him with sweets for forty days, in the hope that the princes blood will cure his sickness. The princess falls in love with the foreign youth. Main parts: Magic Flight. The daughter of the demon (king) uses her magical power to flee together with the youth. She leaves magic speaking objects (spittle, blood) behind to deceive her father [D1611]. Nevertheless the flight is discovered and the father follows them. In order to escape, the girl transforms herself and her fianc into various things or persons (e.g. into rose and thornbush, church and priest, lake and duck) [D671], or she throws magic objects (comb, brush, mirror, etc.)which become obstacles in the way of the pursuer [D672]. After the third transformation, the pursuer has to give up (dies). Cf. Type 310. In some variants of the Magic Flight two children (brother and sister) flee from a witch (demon, dragon, ogre, witch, wolf, bad stepmother). (Previously Type 313H*.) Forgotten Fiance [D2003]. The youth goes to visit his home and leaves his bride behind. At home he breaks a taboo: Disobeying the brides warning, he kisses someone (eats something) and thus forgets his experiences [D2004.2, C234, D2004.3]. When the youth is about to marry another woman, the forgotten fiance reawakens his memory by performing magic actions (paralyses three lovers in embarrassing positions [D2006.1.1], magically stops the wedding carriage of the new bride [D2006.1.5], brings a couple of birds who remind the youth of her help [D2006.1.3], or buys a place for three nights in the bridal bed from her husbands new bride, and in the third night successfully reawakens his memory [D1978.4, D2006.1.4], etc.). The youth marries the true bride."
2106,313E*,The Sisters Flight (previously Girl Flees from Brother who Wants to Marry her),"A brother wants to marry his sister. (Cf. Type 510B.) She flees and arrives in the underworld at the house of a witch. There she meets the witchs daughter who resembles her. Both girls escape from the sorceress by a magic flight, throwing objects behind them. (Cf. Type 313.) The girls change into birds, and the brother is not able to distinguish them. He pretends he is going to kill himself. The sister betrays herself by an involuntary cry. The brother marries the sorceresss daughter."
2107,314,Goldener (previously The Youth Transformed to a Horse),"(Including the previous Type 532.) This type combines various introductory episodes with a common main part. Cf. Types 314A, 502, and 530. Introductory episodes: (1) A boy has been promised (often in return for magic conception) to a demon (devil, giant) [S211], or he voluntarily becomes a servant in a demons house [G462]. The demon orders him to care for two (groups of) animals, to feed the one and to neglect the other. The boy does not follow these instructions and thus makes friends with the abused animal (magic horse) [B316]. Against the prohibition of the demon, he enters a certain chamber [C611]. As a mark of disobedience, his hair turns gold [C912]. The boy and the magic horse escape from the demon by a magic flight [D672]. (2) A boy (usually the son of a ruler) and a magic foal are close friends. The mother (stepmother) wants to kill the boy. The magic foal warns the boy of her secret murderous attempts. At last the mother demands that the boy or the foal be killed. The boy pretends to agree but asks his father to be allowed to ride the foal one last time. During this ride the foal flies away together with the boy [B184.1.6]. (3) In return for his magic conception, a boy is promised to a demon [G461]. On the way to the demons house, the boy is forewarned (given instructions for how to kill the demon or to flee). In the rooms of the demons house, the boy finds prisoners or corpses (and his hair turns to gold [C912]). The boy kills the demon and flees. Main part: The youth covers his golden hair, pretending to be a scaldhead, and takes service in the kings court as a gardener [K1816.1]. (He says nothing except, I dont know. [C495.1]; previously Type 532). But the youngest princess sees him in his true form ( as a golden-haired knight who destroys and restores the garden three times) [H75.4]. She falls in love with Goldener [T91.6.4] and chooses him as her husband by throwing a golden apple to him [T55.1]. They marry but the angry king banishes the couple to a shabby lodging [L132, L113.1.0.1]. The king demands the help of his sons-in-law. Goldener has only a poor kit and is mocked. With the help of his magic horse he achieves various heroic deeds: He obtains the magic remedy (e.g. milk of a bird, water of life) for the king who had grown blind (cf. Type 551), kills a dragon (cf. Type 300), defeats a foreign army three times in disguise. He is wounded and is bandaged by the king. Three times he withdraws and is mocked as a fool. Cf. Type 530. Goldeners identity is revealed (e.g. by wounds, brands) and his true status is recognized [H55, H56]. The horse asks to be decapitated and becomes a prince (princess, other person)."
2108,314A,The Shepherd and the Three Giants,"A poor youth (orphan, fool, youngest of three brothers) sets out with his only heirloom (e.g. rusty sabre) or with magic objects (stick, flute, etc.)which grateful old people gave him [D817]. He becomes the kings shepherd [L113.1.4]. Cf. Types 570, 592. The youth is allowed to pasture his livestock on the kings land but not on the neighboring territory which belongs to three giants (because no one has ever returned from there). The youth disobeys and, with the help of his magic objects (strength), overcomes the three giants one after the other (sometimes their mother, too) [G500]. In the giants lodging the youth finds a magic horse [B184.1] and armour of three different metals (magic weapons, immeasurable wealth, helpful spirits, enchanted persons). The king promises his daughter to whoever rescues her from a (three) dragon(s) (cf. Type 300), wins a tournament (cf. Type 530), or helps him in battle (cf. Type 314). The youth, wearing his shining armour and riding his magic horse, succeeds three times. He withdraws and hides [R222] until the princess recognizes him as the true champion. The youth marries the princess and becomes king [L161]."
2109,314A*,Animal as Helper in the Flight (previously The Bullock-savior),"(Including the previous Type 314B*.) This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A bull (horse, moose, ox, bear, wolf, birds) helps children (another person) to escape from their pursuer (devil, witch, robbers). (2) The devil (white wolf) wants to abduct (marry) a princess (girl). A goat puts a straw sheaf in the place of the princess, asks the real princess to climb in a cart, covers her with hay, and tells the devil whom he meets on the way that the princess is at home. The devil grabs the sheaf and takes it to hell. The goat brings the girl home. (Previously Type 314B*.)"
2110,315,The Faithless Sister,"Brother and sister leave home (are driven out). The brother kills a number of robbers (devils, giants, dragons) but does not realize that the last one is merely wounded [F615]. The sister helps the wounded robber to recover, and he becomes her lover. In order to get rid of the brother, she pretends to be ill and sends him out to get her the milk (liver) of dangerous animals [K2212.0.2]. The brother spares the animals and they follow him (give him a whistle). After the first attempt fails, the sister binds her brother with a silk thread, or she sends him to a magic mill where the animals are kept. When the couple is about to kill the brother, he whistles for the animals. They (break out from the mill and) tear the robber to pieces. The faithless sister is imprisoned (has to repent and to fill a barrel with her tears). The brother takes to the road, rescues a princess from a dragon [R111.1.1], and marries her [L161]. Cf. Type 300. The sister is brought to the court. She tries to take revenge on her brother by putting a (poisoned) bone into his bed. The brother dies. The animals lick the bone out of his body and he revives. The sister is punished by death."
2111,315A,The Cannibal Sister,"A woman (queen) who has only sons gives birth to a daughter. The girl first devours the animals, then her brothers and parents, and finally the inhabitants of the village (city) [G30, G346]. Only one brother escapes. (Or: At a kings court every night someone devours horses. The elder princes who keep watch fail, but the youngest shoots the monster. He recognizes his baby sister as the cannibal because one of her fingers has been shot off. The youth is driven away [as a liar] or flees [sometimes together with his mother or elder sister].) The youth marries, gives his wife a life token, leaves his dogs (young lions, panther) behind, and returns home. He finds everything devastated. His sister devours his horse and threatens to devour him, too. While she is sharpening her teeth, the youth must play an instrument to prove he is still there. A mouse takes his place and he flees [B521]. The youth escapes and climbs three trees in succession which his sister gnaws down [R251]. Warned by the life token, his dogs come to save him and kill the cannibal sister [B524.1.2]."
2112,316,The Nix of the Mill-pond,"A poor fisherman (miller) (unwittingly) promises his son [S240] to a water nix [F420.1.2], who makes the fisherman wealthy. The parents keep the child away from the water. When the appointed time comes, the son learns about his fathers promise and flees. On the way the youth divides the carcass of an animal among a lion, a falcon, and an ant (other animals) by taking the animals characteristics into consideration. In return he receives from the grateful animals the power to transform himself into their shapes. Using this power he wins a princess as his wife. After winning a battle (while hunting) the youth comes near the water and is seized and pulled down (swallowed) by the water nix [F420.5.2.2]. By offering precious objects (three golden apples), his wife tempts the nix to the surface. In exchange for these objects the water nix exhibits her husband: first up to his head, then up to his waist. When the water nix exhibits the husbands whole body, he changes into a bird and escapes [R152, D642.2]."
2113,317,The Tree that Grows up to the Sky (previously The Stretching Tree),"(Including the previous Type 468.) In a kings yard a tree grows up to the sky [F54.1]. A dragon (giant) living in the tree carries off the princess. The king promises her as a wife to whoever can bring her back. In some variants, the king promises his daughter to whoever brings him healing fruits from the tree. After noble canditates have failed, a young swineherd succeeds in climbing the tree wearing iron boots [Q502.2]. In the upper world the youth guards the dragons magic horse which tells him (he asks the princess to find out) where the dragons power is hidden. The youth kills the dragon, returns to earth together with the princess, and marries her. In some variants, in the upper world the youth watches over the magic horses of a fairy (Tndr Ilona) who gives him clothes of copper, silver, and gold. The fairy falls in love and marries the youth. The youth enters a forbidden chamber [C611] and frees a dragon which carries off the fairy. Continuation as in Type 302C*."
2114,318,The Faithless Wife,"(Including the previous Type 590A.) Introduction: Two brothers live together. The younger works for the elder, who is married. The wife attempts to seduce the younger brother but he refuses her. She complains to her husband that her brother-in-law attacked her [K2111]. The youth flees from his angry brother. In some variants, this part continues as follows: The fugitive is caught and castrated. After this he lives in a foreign city. A princess falls in love with him and marries him in spite of his mutilation. When the king learns of his son-in-laws defect, the latter has to flee. He is cured by a supernatural being and is able to return to his wife. Main part: A youth acquires magic objects, among them a magic gift (rusty sword, shirt that imparts strength) from a serpent which he rescued (by theft, by other means). Using these objects, he helps a king to be victorious and, in return, marries a princess. The princess has a lover [T232]. She persuades her husband to give her the magic objects (exchanges them) [K2213]. The husband is killed and, as he had requested, his dismembered body is loaded on his horse and carried to the serpents castle. The dead youth is resuscitated (by the serpent) and given the power of self-transformation. As a horse with a golden mane he is sold to the king. The princess recognizes the horse as her former husband and orders that it be killed. (On his advice) a maidservant catches drops of its blood which turn into a tree with golden apples. The princess recognizes the tree as her former husband, and orders that it be felled. (On his advice) the maidservant throws a chip into a pond, where it turns into a golden drake [D610]. The lover, leaving the sword and shirt behind, tries to catch the drake. The drake becomes a man and uses his magic power to kill his rival and his treacherous wife. He marries the maidservant."
2115,321,Eyes Recovered from Witch,"A youth takes service as a herdsman with a blind man (couple) whose eyes have been stolen by one or more dragon(s) (giant, witch, fairy). The youth is warned not to take his flock to pasture beyond a certain point, but he disobeys. He meets a dragon and defeats it or tricks it. He retrieves the stolen eyes [D2161.3.1.1] or receives a magic remedy which enables him to cure the blind man."
2116,322*,Magnetic Mountain Draws Everything to It,"A kings ship is drawn to a magnetic mountain and smashed to pieces, and the king is washed ashore unconscious [F754]. Advised in a dream [D1814.2, F1068], the king finds a copper bow [D1091] with three lead arrows [D1092]. As instructed he climbs the mountain without looking back [C331] or speaking [C400] and shoots a copper rider off a copper horse in a temple with copper pillars. The rider falls into the sea, and the king buries the horse. The magnetic mountain begins to sink. A copper man arrives in a copper boat and rescues the king at the last moment. In some variants, the rescuer is a giant bird."
2117,325,The Magician and his Pupil,"A father apprentices his son to a magician [D1711.0.1]. In order for the son to be released at the end of the apprenticeship, the father has to recognize him [H62.1, H161]. The youth secretly learns how to practice magic and flees, or his father identifies him among a flock of identical doves (other birds) with the help of tokens which the son (an old man) had given to him. The son is released. The father sells the youth successively as a greyhound, an ox, and a horse, but the son tells him not to sell the things that bind them (leash, yoke, bridle). Thus father and son become wealthy [D612, K252]. But at last the youth as a horse returns to the magicians influence because, contrary to instructions, the father let the magician take the bridle. So the youth loses his power and is tormented by the magician [C837]. Finally the youth succeeds in removing the bridle. He conquers the magician in a transformation combat (they change themselves into hare, fish, bird, etc.)and escapes [D722, D615.2]. At last, transformed into a ring (apple, etc.), he falls into a princesss lap. When the magician asks for the ring, the princess throws it away and grains of corn fall on the ground.

2120,326,The Youth Who Wanted to Learn What Fear Is,"A youth (fool) who does not know what fear is goes to find it [H1376.2]. He tries various frightening experiences without becoming afraid [H1400]: He is shaved by a barber-ghost [E571], spends the night under a gallows [H1415] or in a haunted castle [E281], plays with dead persons (bowling [E577.3], cards [E577.2]), etc. Through his fearless behavior he disenchants a castle (wins a treasure, a promised princess) [Q82]. The youth finally learns what fear is when cold water is thrown on him [H1441], fishes are put into his bed while he is asleep [H1441.1], birds fly into his face, his cut-off head is put on backwards, etc. Sometimes sexual: he finds a woman in his bed."

2123,327,The Children and the Ogre,"This type refers to a cycle of related tales. It combines episodes from types 327A, 327B, and 327C."
2124,327A,Hansel and Gretel,"A (poor) father (persuaded by the stepmother) abandons his children (a boy and a girl) in the forest [S321, S143]. Twice the children find their way back home, following scattered pebbles [R135]. On the third night, birds eat the scattered peas (bread-crumbs) [R135.1]. The children come upon a gingerbread house which belongs to a witch (ogress) [G401, F771.1.10, G412.1]. She takes them into her house. The boy is fattened [G82], while the girl must do housework. The witch asks the boy to show his finger in order to test how fat he is [G82.1], but he shows her a bone (stick) [G82.1.1]. When the witch wants to cook the boy, the sister deceives her by feigning ignorance and pushes her into the oven [G526, G512.3.2]. (The witchs son finds out that his mother has been killed and pursues the children.) The children escape, carrying the witchs treasure with them. Birds and beasts (angels) help them across water. They return home. Cf. Type 327."
2125,327B,The Brothers and the Ogre (previously The Dwarf and the Giant),"Seven (three, twelve, thirty) brothers come to an ogres house, where they are given night lodging. The ogre intends to cut off the brotherss heads. In order to recognize his own daughters, the ogre gives them nightcaps (head-scarves). One brother (often the youngest, Thumbling) detects the plan, and all brothers put on the nightcaps of the ogres daughters (exchange their caps for the daughters head-scarves, change sleeping-places with the daughters).

2126,327C,The Devil (Witch) Carries the Hero Home in a Sack,"A witch (ogre) entices a boy (conceived by magic, Thumbling) into her bag and carries him away (from his home). By deceiving the witch (putting stones, thorns, mud, etc. in his place), the boy is able to escape twice from the bag. The third time, the witch carries him to her home. He is to be killed by the witchs daughter. The boy tricks the daughter (by making her show him how he should prepare to be killed [G526]), throws her into a pot (burns her in the oven), and serves her as a meal to her family [G61]. He taunts the witch, kills her, and returns home (sometimes with the witchs treasure)."
2127,327D,The Kiddelkaddelkar,"A boy and a girl lose their way in a forest and come to the house of an ogre. The wife protects the children, but the ogre discovers them and intends to hang them. The girl persuades the ogre to show them how it is done. Hanging himself, the ogre begs to be released and promises the children his kiddelkaddelkar, a magic cart pulled by (golden) bucks, and much treasure. The children flee and on the way ask three men not to reveal their route. The third man is so much frightened by the ogre that he betrays the children, who hide in a cave. The ogre, not suspecting the childrens presence, lies down to sleep and blocks the way out. The children kill him but cannot leave the cave for three nights until a giant bird eats the ogres corpse. Then they return to their parents with the ogres treasure."
2128,327F,The Witch and the Fisher Boy,"By imitating the words and voice of his mother who brings him food to the shore each day, a witch tries to catch a fisher boy. She succeeds after she has her tongue made thin by a smith [F556.2, K1832], and carries the boy to her home. When the witchs daughter tries to bake the boy, he pushes her into the oven [G526, G512.3.2]. The boy hides in a tree and tells the witch that she has eaten her own daughter (witch finds the daughters ring or hair). He is discovered. The witch fells the tree, but at the last moment birds rescue the boy (he makes wings for himself), and he flies home (the witch is trampled by animals, or she bursts while trying to drink the boys image reflected in the water)."
2129,327G,The Brothers at the Witchs House (previously The Boy at the Devils [Witchs] House),"A witch (devil) catches three brothers one of them a fool and fattens them. Her youngest daughter is to roast one of them. The fool pretends he does not know how to lie on the bread paddle and roasts the daughter, whom the old witch eats unwittingly.

Using tricks the youth gets these objects. Cf. Types 1525, 1525A. At last the brothers claim that the youngest can kidnap the ogre himself [H1172]. In disguise the youth tells the ogre that the thief died and persuades him to lie down in the coffin to measure it [G514.1]. The youth nails up the coffin, traps the ogre, and is given a princess as his wife. In some variants, the youth sets out to steal from the ogre in order to get revenge for former ill-treatment [G610.1] or to help a friendly king [G610.3]. In some variants, mainly from northern and north-western Europe and the Americas, the protagonist is female."
2131,328*,Three Giants with One Eye (previously A Boy Guards the Kings Garden),Two brothers lose their way in a forest (a son leaves his parents house and takes a rest while walking through a forest). They are threatened by three giants (trolls) who share only one eye which they put by turns into their foreheads [G121.1]. The brothers steal the giantseye [G612] and give it back in exchange for a rich reward of gold and silver (magic gifts).
2132,328A,Jack and the Beanstalk,"A poor boy named Jack trades his cow for some beans (his mother finds a bean while sweeping the house). One of the beans grows into a giant beanstalk [F54.2], which Jack climbs to an upper world where he finds the house of a giant. The giants wife gives him food and hides him when her husband comes home. The giant smells human flesh [G84] but his wife tells him he is mistaken [G532]. The giant eats dinner, counts his money, and then falls asleep. Jack steals the money and runs home down the beanstalk. He makes two more trips, stealing the giants hen that lays golden eggs [B103.2.1] and his self-playing harp [D1601.18]. The third time, the harp cries out and awakens the giant, who runs after Jack. Jack reaches the bottom of the beanstalk and chops it down. The giant falls to his death, and Jack and his mother have plenty of money."
2133,328A*,"Three Brothers Steal Back the Sun, Moon, and Star","Three brothers go out to retrieve the sun, the moon, and the stars which were stolen by three multi-headed dragons (devils). One of the brothers (often the son of a she-dog) defeats the dragons and releases the celestial lights. Cf. Type 300A."
2134,329,Hiding from the Princess (previously Hiding from the Devil),"A princess promises to marry whoever can hide himself so well that she cannot find him [H321]. Those who fail are beheaded (heads are displayed on stakes) [H901.1]. A (poor) youth (youngest of three brothers) undertakes the task. Because he had helped some animals (an old man), a fish hides him in his belly, an eagle behind the clouds (the sun), and a fox under the earth [D684, H982]. The princess finds him with her magic mirror (magic book) or her perfect sight. The princess gives the youth a fourth trial: He hides behind the magic mirror (under the princesss seat) or transforms himself (is transformed) and sits as a louse (sticks as a rose) in her hair, etc. [D641]. The princess cannot find him, so she grants his superiority and marries him."
2135,330,The Smith and the Devil (previously The Smith Outwits the Devil),"(Bonhomme Misre.) (Including the previous Types 330AD and 330*.) A smith, who because of poverty (other reasons) sold his soul to the devil (death) [M211], gives shelter to Christ and St. Peter during their visit on earth [K1811]. In reward, three of his wishes shall be fulfilled [Q115] (cf. Type 750A). St. Peter warns him to wish for a place in paradise, but the smith wants a tree and a bench (chair) to which people stick and a knapsack that draws people into it [J2071, D1413.1, D1413.5, D1412.1] (a pack of cards with which he shall always win [N221], etc.). Cf. Type 753A. When the devil (death) is about to carry the smith away, he sticks to the bench and the tree and has to give the smith more time to live (terminate the contract), or no one would be able to die [Z111.2]. At last the devil is put into the sack and beaten up (on the anvil) [K213]. The smith, tired of life, cannot go either to heaven or to hell [Q565]. He tricks St. Peter by pushing his knapsack into heaven, where it pulls him in [K2371.1.3] (throws his cards inside the gate of heaven and is permitted inside to pick them up). In some variants the trickster-protagonist is an allegorical figure (e.g. Misery, Envy, Poverty) who traps the devil in a tree until the devil promises him immortality. Then he sets the devil free. (Previously Type 330D.)"
2136,331,The Spirit in the Bottle,"A man (son of a woodcutter, smith, fisherman, soldier) frees an evil spirit from a vessel (bottle) out of curiosity (because he was asked by the spirit) [R181]. The spirit (which stretches out to an enormous height,) wants to take revenge for being locked for so long, and threatens to kill his rescuer. The man tricks the spirit: He pretends he does not believe that the spirit could grow small again and thus induces him to go back into the vessel [K717]. The man stoppers the bottle and the spirit is trapped. In some variants, he is released again in return for a gift (wonderful remedy, magic power [D1240, D2102]). Cf. Types 155, 735A."
2137,332,Godfather Death,"(Including the previous Types 332A* and 332B*.) A poor man with many children wants a (just) godfather for his newborn son. He refuses God (saint, devil) and chooses death (angel of death, plague) because he treats everyone alike [Z111, J486]. As a gift the father (son) receives the magic power of forecasting recovery or death, depending on whether death stands at the head or the foot of the sick persons bed [D1825.3.1]. Thus the man becomes a famous doctor and grows wealthy. The doctor betrays death (several times): When promised wealth (the princess), the doctor turns the bed and thus saves the life of a person who was supposed to die [K557] (in the doctors dying hour, death grants him time to say a last Paternoster, but the doctor does not finish the prayer [K551.1] cf. Type 1199. Death tricks the doctor into finishing the prayer.) In some variants, death shows the man his life-light in the underworld and suddenly extinguishes it [E765.1.3, K551.9]. Or the man attempts to lengthen his life by various means (usually without success). (Previously Type 332A*.) Cf. Type 1187."
2138,332C*,Immortality Won through Betrayal of Death,"This tale exists in two different forms: (1) An old soldier becomes the doorkeeper for heaven. Death asks him several times whom he should take next. God wants death to take the old people (then people in the middle of their life, then young people in succession). However, the doorkeeper wants to save his parents (wife, children), so he tells death instead to fell firs (beech-trees, oaks). God discovers this deception and shows death whom he should take next. Thus the soldier and his relatives are reunited in heaven. (In some variants, the soldier is banished to hell. Here he delivers a number of souls from purgatory and is chased away. Cf. Type 475.) (2) A prince wants to gain immortality. He travels through three different kingdoms, in which the rulers have to perform tasks which must be finished within 600 (800, 1000) years (pulling out a tree, carrying off a mountain, wearing out thousands of sewing needles). During this time death has lost his power. Each time the prince is given magic objects and asked to stay, but he travels on. Finally he arrives at the empire of immortality. After a thousand years he goes to look for his parents. The queen of immortality gives him water of life which he uses to resuscitate the deceased rulers of the three kingdoms. The prince, finding no trace of his former home and family, returns. Pursued by death, he reaches the border of the empire of immortality. In a contest with death, the queen of immortality wins the prince and they live together forever."
2139,333,Little Red Riding Hood (previously The Glutton),"(Petit Chaperon Rouge, Cappuccetto rosso, Rotkppchen.) (Including the previous Type 333A.) A little girl, called Red Riding Hood because of her red cap, is sent to her grandmother who lives in the forest and is warned not to leave the path [J21.5]. On the way she meets a wolf. The wolf learns where the girl is going, hurries on ahead, and devours the grandmother (puts her blood in a glass and her flesh in a pot). He puts on her clothes and lies down in her bed. Red Riding Hood arrives at the grandmothers house. (She has to drink the blood, eat the flesh, and lie down in the bed.) Red Riding Hood doubts whether the wolf is her grandmother and asks him about his odd big ears [Z18.1], eyes, hands, and mouth. Finally the wolf eats Red Riding Hood [K2011]. A hunter kills the wolf and cuts open his belly. Red Riding Hood and the grandmother are rescued alive [F913]. They fill the wolfs belly with stones [Q426]; he is drowned or falls to his death. Cf. Types 123, 2028. In some variants Red Riding Hood arrives at the grandmothers house before the wolf. The wolf climbs on the roof to wait until Red Riding Hood leaves. The Grandmother who had boiled sausages asks Red Riding Hood to fill the broth into a big trough in front of the house. Enticed by the smell, the wolf falls from the roof and is drowned in the trough. In an Italian version, a woman who is going to bake cakes sends out her daughter (Caterinella, Caterina, Cattarinetta) to borrow a pan. The lender, an ogre (witch, wolf), asks the girl to bring back some cakes and wine. On her way she eats the cakes, drinks the wine, and replaces them with horse-dung and urine. Angry about the trick, the ogre pursues the girl home and devours her (is not able to get into the house, is tricked out by the girls mother). (Previously Type 333A.)"

Cf. Type 363."
2141,335,Deaths Messengers,"Death promises to warn a certain man before he comes to him, so the man lives happily.

2142,360,Bargain of the Three Brothers with the Devil,"Three traveling journeymen (brothers, friends) conclude an agreement with the devil: They receive a large amount of money (purse which will never be empty) on the condition that they pledge themselves always to say the same words, we three, for gold, that was right [C495.2.1, M175]. The host of an inn kills a rich merchant and accuses the journeymen. Because of their stereotyped answers they seem to confess the offence. Cf. Type 1697. The devil rescues them from the gallows [R175]. The host is hanged in their place, and the devil is satisfied to take his soul and leave the journeymen alone [K217]."
2143,361,Bear-skin,"A poor soldier sells his soul to the devil for an immense amount of money (a purse which will never be empty) [M211].

The soldier helps a poor man, who agrees to let him marry one of his daughters. The two elder daughters scoff at the dirty man, but the youngest daughter agrees to marry him [L54.1]. The soldier leaves her a token (half of a ring or coin). After seven years the bargain is completed. The devil washes and dresses the soldier, and releases him. He returns to his bride as a rich gentleman and is recognized by the token. The envious elder sisters commit suicide. Thus instead of one soul the devil gets two (sometimes more) [K217]. Cf. Type 475."
