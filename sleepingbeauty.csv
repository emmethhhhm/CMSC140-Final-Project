2040,450,Little Brother and Little Sister,"Little brother and little sister run away from their home because of their cruel stepmother [S31.5, S31] or because their parents want to eat them. In spite his sisters warning, the brother drinks from a spring or an animals track [D555] and is transformed into a deer [D114.1.1] (lamb [D135], goat). The children live together in the forest until a prince finds them [P253.2, N711.1]. The sister hides up in a tree but the prince tricks her into coming down. She marries the prince and they take the animal brother with them. The prince is absent when their child is born. The sister is replaced by another bride [K1911, K1911.1.2], often the daughter of a bad woman (stepmother, witch, maid). The sister is thrown into the water [S142], transformed into a bird [D150] (fish [D170]), or swallowed by a fish [K1911.2.2.1]. She returns at night to suckle her child [E323.1.1, D688] and to look after her brother. A servant overhears the conversation between the animal brother and the sister and informs the prince [H13]. The false bride and her mother are punished. Cf. Type 403. In some variants the false bride and her mother want to kill the animal brother because they fear that the truth will be discovered. The cook saves him."
2041,451,The Maiden Who Seeks her Brothers,"(Including the previous Types 451A and 451*.) A girl rescues her twelve (seven, three, six) brothers [P253.0.5, P251.6.7, Z71.5.1] who had been transformed into animals (birds) [P253.2]. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms but they are often mixed with each other: (1) A stepmother transforms her stepsons into swans [D161.1] (ravens [D151.5]). The sister looks for her brothers and finds out how to release them: She has to be silent for some years [D758] and has to make shirts out of cotton-grass for the brothers [D753.1]. A king finds the young woman in the forest and marries her [N711]. In his absence she bears a child, but her mother-in-law takes it away and accuses her of eating the child [K2116.1.1] (having borne an animal). The young queen remains silent because of her brothers, even though she is to be executed. On her way to the funeral pyre her period of silence ends and her brothers are disenchanted. Everything is explained and the mother-in-law is punished. In some variants the disenchantment of one brother is not complete (he keeps a wing) because the sister cried a tear when her child was taken away (did not completely finish his shirt). (2) A girl finds her brothers in a remote place and keeps house for them. They tell her to take care of the cat (dog), watch the fire, and be careful of the demonic neighbor (ogre, witch). Once she forgets to divide her food with the cat, so it puts out the fire. After the girl asks the neighbor for help, the ogre comes regularly to suck her blood. When the brothers discover this, they kill him. The girl takes flowers (herbs) from the grave of the ogre. Her brothers eat them and they are changed into oxen (sheep, birds). The episode of disenchantment is less important. (3) A mother (father) curses her sons because there is not enough to eat. They are transformed into ravens (swans). The sister seeks for them and asks for directions from the sun, moon, and stars [H1232]. She finds her brothers on a glass mountain (glass palace). To reach them she needs a little bone as a key (gets help from the wind). She releases her brothers and they go back home. In some variants the episode with marriage and slander follows. Some variants start with the promise of the mother to sacrifice the brothers if a daughter (one more brother) is born [S272]. She tries to inform the boys after the birth by a sign [T595], but the wrong sign is sent [N344.1], so the brothers leave home [S272.1]."
2042,452B*,The Sisters as Oxen,"A witch and her daughter are jealous of three beautiful orphan girls who are in the kings favor. The witch puts magic powder in the girls soup and the two elder girls eat it and are transformed into oxen. The king asks the youngest girl to marry him and she accepts on condition that the oxen are cared for in the kings palace. The witch visits the palace and sticks two pins in the queens head, so she becomes a dove. The witchs daughter pretends to be the queen. The dove comes to the palace and is caught by a gardener, who has heard it speak. The king removes the pins from its head and it regains human form. The witch and her daughter are burned to death. Cf. Type 408."
2043,459,The Make-Believe Son (Daughter),A king casts out his first wife because she is childless. Later a maidservant informs the king that this queen has born a son (daughter) but the king is not allowed to see it. The queen is supplied with a house and food. After some years the king arranges a marriage for his child. The maidservant makes an image of a youth or puts an animal in a sedan-chair. A god pities the queen and vivifies the image or turns the animal into a handsome youth (young woman). The king is reconciled with the queen. In some variants a prince falls in love with a doll thinking it is a young woman and he wants to marry her. Her parents convince him to marry the daughter of their neighbor.
2044,425,The Search for the Lost Husband,"This type refers to a cycle of related tales. It combines episodes from types 425A425E, 425M, and 425*. Cf. Types 400, 430, 432, and 441."
2045,425*,The Insulted Bridegroom Disenchanted (previously Enchanted Animal Husband Insulted by Guests),"A princess (the youngest of three sisters) wants to marry. Her father insists that she must marry the first one whom she meets (whoever picks up a certain rose). A mouse with a stinking tail (a poor man carrying water) comes by, and the princess marries him [T118]. During the wedding feast, when guests insult the mouse-bridegroom, the castle and all its inhabitants disappear, and the princess finds herself alone. She sets out on a quest for her lost husband [H1385.4]. Two hermits direct her to the underworld. There she finds the castle of the mouse-bridegroom. Through her love he is disenchanted and turns into a beautiful prince [D700]. In some variants the princess lives in poverty with her husband. She dreams of a splendid castle and of wealth. Two times the dream comes true, and she invites her relatives to the castle. When her poor husband appears, someone calls his name and the castle disappears. The third time, she instructs them not to call her husbands name. Thus he is disenchanted."
2046,425A,The Animal as Bridegroom,"(Including the previous Type 425G.) This type combines various introductory episodes with a common main part. Cf. Types 430, 432, and 441. Introductory episodes: (1) The youngest daughter asks her father (the king) to bring her a (musical) rose (lark, etc.)from his journey. He finds it in the garden of a beast, but in return has to promise his daughter (the first being he meets when he arrives at home) [L221, S228, S241] to the beast. The father tries in vain to send another girl instead of his daughter [S252]. Cf. Type 425C. (2) An animal-son (snake, crayfish, also pumpkin, etc.)is born (because of the hasty wish of his parents) [C758.1]. He demands a princess for his wife and performs difficult (impossible) tasks. The princess has to marry him [T111]. (3) A girl is intended (by fate) for an animal bridegroom or agrees to marry him [B620.1, L54.1]. (4) For other reasons a girl has an animal husband and lives together with him in his castle. He becomes a beautiful man by night [D621.1, B640.1]. Main part: When the young wife (often on the advice of her female relatives) burns the animal-skin of her bridegroom [C757.1] (looks at him during the night or burns him with candle wax [C32.1, C916.1], reveals his secret [C421], or otherwise prevents his disenchantment), he goes away [C932]. The young wife sets out for a long and difficult quest [H1385.4] (in iron shoes [Q502.2], etc.). On her way she is given directions and precious gifts by the sun, moon, wind, and stars [H1232] (helpful old people or animals [H1233.1.1, H1235]. She arrives (sometimes by climbing a glass mountain [H1114]) at her bridegrooms far-away residence. She finds that her husband has another (supernatural) bride. She takes service as maid [Q482.1] and trades her precious things (golden implements for spinning, jewels, magnificent clothes, etc.)for three nights by the side of her lost husband [D2006.1.1]. She wants to awaken his memory of her, but two times he is drugged by a soporific. He spills the soporific on the third night, stays awake, and recognizes her as his true bride [D2006.1.4]. (Death of the false bride.) Cf. Type 313."
2047,425B,Son of the Witch (previously The Disenchanted Husband: the Witchs Tasks),"(Cupid and Psyche.) (Including the previous Types 425J, 425N, and 428.) This type combines various introductory episodes with a common main part. Cf. Type 425A. Introductory episodes: A young woman marries a supernatural bridegroom: (1) She is given to her bridegroom because of a present that she has asked her father to bring back from a journey [S228]. (2) The bridegroom performs a set of difficult tasks. (3) She pulls up an herb and discovers the bridegrooms subterranean castle (a wind carries her there). (4) She finds him in another way. The bridegroom is the son of a witch (ogress) or he is (during the day) an animal [D621.1]. Main part: The young woman breaks the bridegroom`s prohibition (cf. Typ 425A), and he goes away [C932]. (Before he leaves, he gives her a token, e.g. ring, feather.) (In iron shoes) she sets out to find him [H1385.4, H1125]. The bride comes to the house of her bridegrooms mother, a witch, who swears by her sons name not to devour her. The witch imposes difficult tasks on the young woman, which she performs (with the help of her bridegroom): to sort a large quantity of grain [H1122], to fill mattresses with the feathers of all kinds of birds, to wash the black wool white and the white black [H1023.6, cf. Type 1183], to sweep a house but leave it unswept [H1066], etc. In some variants she enchants (three) suitors and makes them fight (part of previous Type 425N). Cf. Types 313, 875. The young woman is sent on a dangerous journey to bring a casket from the sister of the witch. Having passed obstacles (with the advice from her bridegroom) and obtained the casket, she is forbidden to open it. (Cf. Types 408, 480.) When the bride acts against the prohibition, her husband helps her. At the wedding of the bridegroom and the witchs daughter, the young woman has to hold ten burning candles (torches). Her bridegroom saves her from being burned. The young woman remarries her bridegroom, or both escape by a magic (transformation) flight [D671, D672]. In some variants a female demon (witch) demands that a young woman accomplish impossible tasks [G204, H1010, H931]. Among other things, the girl has to bring a letter to another demon telling her to kill the girl [K978] (cf. Type 930). A wolf helps the girl to escape the danger [B435.3]. As a reward, the wolf is disenchanted. He turns to a prince [D113.1] and marries the young woman. (Previously Type 428.)"
2048,425C,Beauty and the Beast,"(Including the previous Type 425H.) A merchant sets out on a journey and intends to bring back presents for his three daughters. The two elder ones demand jewels and clothes, the youngest a rose [L221]. The father is not able to find one. He loses his way and stays overnight in a deserted castle, where he breaks off a rose. An (invisible) animal (beast) demands that the man return or send a substitute [S222]. The youngest daughter meets her fathers obligation but refuses to marry the (ugly) animal, who treats her kindly. In a magic mirror she sees her father is ill. She is allowed to visit him but (influenced by her envious sisters) overstays the allotted time [C761.2]. She returns and finds the animal near death, realizes she loves him, and caresses or kisses him. By this means she disenchants the prince from his animal shape [D735.1]. They marry."
2049,425D,The Vanished Husband (previously Vanished Husband Learned of by Keeping Inn (Bath-house),"(Including the previous Type 425F.) (A childless couple adopts an animal or object which grows up and wants to marry; cf. Type 433B). The animal (crayfish, frog, he-goat, bird, etc. , or the head of a donkey) performs the tasks set for the suitors [T68] and marries the kings youngest daughter. During the night he turns into a beautiful young man [B640.1]. He warns his wife against telling his secret, but she breaks the taboo and he leaves her [C932]. The wife sets up an inn (bakery, bathhouse) where everyone who tells a tale gets free service [H11.1.1] (disguised as a man [K1837], she gives a golden coin to everyone she meets, if they will tell a tale). She thus learns where her husband lives and how to save him [C991]. She finds her husband and disenchants him. In some variants a princess loses her enchanted bridegroom, a bird [D150], and becomes melancholy. The king promises a reward to anyone who can make the princess laugh [H1194]. An old woman, who knows where the bridegroom lives, tells the princess and makes her laugh. The princess finds her bridegroom in his castle. She releases him from his enchantment by starving for seven years (standing without shelter out in the wind and rain for a year or more). By doing this she becomes so ugly that the prince does not want her. With the help of kind fairies she becomes beautiful and wealthy. Her bridegroom falls in love with her. She makes demands on him (he must build a bridge and lie down in a coffin). They are reunited. (Previously Type 425F.)"
2050,425E,The Enchanted Husband Sings Lullaby,"(Including the previous Type 425L.) A young woman follows an enchanted man (usually a prince) to his underground castle (grotto) and marries him. During the night her husband takes on his human shape. He forbids her to open a certain room [C611] (she is not allowed to watch him at night, to wake him up, to open the padlock of his heart or to look through a keyhole into his body). She breaks the taboo and, although she is pregnant, she is chased away. The pregnant woman finds lodging in the house of a rich woman (queen) whose son had disappeared a long time ago. Here she gives birth to a child. At night the enchanted husband visits his sleeping wife, sings a lullaby to the child, and thus tells how he may be disenchanted (roosters must not crow, church bells must not ring, etc.). Maidservants report this to the lady of the house. In the third night the conditions demanded in the song are met (the enchanted man is embraced or seized). The man is released from the enchantment and is recognized as the missing son. (Previously Type 425L.) Cf. Type 434."
2051,425M,The Snake as Bridegroom (previously Bathing Girls Garments Kept),"A serpent (water being, dragon) steals the clothes of a bathing girl and gives them back only when she promises to marry him [K1335]. The serpent takes her as his bride to his splendid castle (at the bottom of the sea) where she gives birth to two children. The serpent promises that the woman may visit her parents if she performs certain impossible tasks (wearing out iron shoes [H1125, Q502.2], spinning an endless thread, etc.) [H1010]. By following the advice of an old woman she succeeds [N825.3], and finally she and her children are allowed to visit her parents for three days. But she is warned not to tell anyone about her husband [C421]. The woman keeps the promise. The children, however, tell the relatives about their father and give away the secret of the magic formula by which he can be summoned. The womans brothers call the serpent and kill him. Together with her children the woman returns. She calls her husband, but there is only blood in the sea. So she realises that the children have betrayed her and condemns them to be turned into trees [D215]."
2052,426,"The Two Girls, the Bear, and the Dwarf","During the winter two sisters (called Snow White and Rose Red) invite a bear into their hut. Three times the sisters rescue an evil dwarf who was going to steal some treasures, but he is ungrateful and insults them [F451.2.3.1, K1111.1, F451.6.1, F451.5.2.1]. Thereupon the bear (who had been enchanted by the dwarf) catches him. The dwarf offers treasures to the bear if he will devour the girls instead of him. But the bear kills the dwarf and thus is disenchanted and turns into a prince [D763]. The prince marries one of the sisters and his brother (who was not mentioned until then) the other."
2053,430,The Donkey (Asinarius),"After a royal couple have long wished for children, the queen finally gives birth to a donkey. Raised as a human, he learns courtly customs and how to sing and play the lyre (harp, etc.) [D963]. On the day when he first sees a reflection of his face, he runs away accompanied by a servant. In a foreign country he entertains the kings court with his musical talents. He meets the kings daughter and is charmed by her beauty. When the donkey wants to return home, the king tries to prevent him by offering him his daughter in marriage [B641.4]. On the wedding night the donkey takes off his skin and turns into a handsome prince. A servant who observes this tells the king, who burns up the skin on the following night [D721.3]. The prince, unable to become a donkey again, wants to flee, but the king stops him and gives him part of his kingdom. Cf. Type 425A."
2054,431,The House in the Forest,"Three sisters one after the other go to a house in the forest where an old man lives with his three animals [D1890, D166.1.1, D166.1, D133.1]. The two older girls cook and make a bed only for the man, not for the animals, nor do they wait for the old man to go to bed before they do [Q2]. He shuts them up in his cellar. The youngest girl takes care of the animals, feeds them [L54] and takes the leftovers for herself, and goes to bed only after the old man is settled down for the night. She wakes up in a palace. Instead of the old man, she finds a young prince, who, together with his three servants, had been enchanted by a witch. The girl and the prince marry [L162], and the sisters must serve as maids until they prove themselves to be sympathetic to animals. In some variants a woman spoils her lazy, bad-tempered daughter and mistreats the industrious stepsister, giving her only a little food. She follows a rolling loaf of bread to a (enchanted) house in the forest. She shares her food with animals who live there (whom she has brought with her) and is kind to an old man or an animal-man (forest spirit). On the advice of the animals, she takes the man to bed with her, and he is disenchanted (along with the animals) [D731]. She marries the man or is given a reward. The jealous sister comes to the house with good food, but does not share it with the animals, so they do not give her advice. She is unkind to the old man (spirit) and is (severely) punished. Cf. Type 480."
2055,432,The Prince as Bird,"The youngest of three sisters asks her father, when he goes on a journey, to bring her an unusual present (feather, plant, book, violin, mirror, pearl, etc.) [L221]. The father at first cannot find such a thing, but then he obtains it from an unknown prince. (Cf. Types 425A, 425B, 425C, 894.) The daughter uses the present to call its owner, who comes (in bird form) through her window [D641.1]. The envious sisters (stepmother) spy and discover the lover. They put knives or broken glass around the window [K2212.1, S181]. The prince is wounded and does not visit any more. The youngest daughter (disguises herself as a man [K1837] and) goes to look for her lover [H1385.5]. She overhears a conversation between birds (demonic beings, who meet in or under a tree) who speak about where the prince is and how he can be cured by a medicine [N452]. The woman prepares the medicine, finds her lover, and heals him. In payment, he gives her a present (ring, hair, shirt, horse). The prince recognizes his love. Or, back home, she summons him by means of the feather (etc.). He comes but is angry because he believes that she had injured him, and she explains what really happened. She shows him the second present (ring, shirt etc.) to prove that it was she who had cured him. They are reconciled [B642]."
2056,433B,King Lindorm,"(Including the previous Types 433, 433A, and 433C.) Cf. Type 430. This tale deals with a brave woman who marries a snake (worm, frog or toad, lizard, another animal). She disenchants him by kissing or embracing him or by sharing his bed [D735.1], or because she wears more shirts than he has layers of skin. (Previously Types 433 and 433A.) Cf. Types 425A, 441, 480, 711. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A poor woman gives birth to a snake (a couple adopt a snake or a frog as their child). When the animal grows up he wants to marry the daughter of the king. The king sets impossible tasks, which the snake accomplishes (the snake frightens the king). The snake marries the princess, and after the wedding he turns into a handsome man (prince). (2) A childless queen (through a hasty wish [T513] or magic conception [T510]) gives birth to an animal son (snake, dragon, etc.) whom she keeps secret. When he grows up he wants to marry, but every woman who marries him is killed on her wedding night. One courageous young woman (a mistreated stepdaughter) puts on seven shirts one on top of the other (on the advice of a wise woman, her dead mother). She challenges the snake to shed one of his skins every time she takes off one of her shirts. When he is completely stripped, she whips him and then bathes him in milk [D766.1]. She lies down beside him and he turns into a handsome young man. (The skins are destroyed [D721.3].) (3) A young woman marries a snake who gives her jewelry and turns into a handsome young man. The woman burns the snake skin and lives happily with her husband. Another jealous woman tells her father she too wants to marry a snake. She is left in a room alone with such an animal, who kills her. (Previously Type 433C.) In some variants after the husband is disenchanted, the woman is (slandered by a jealous woman and) banished. She disenchants a prince (who has been transformed into a bird) or a dead man, marries him, and gives birth to a son. Her first husband finds her after a long search. She must choose between the husbands and decides to stay with the first."
2057,434,The Stolen Jewelry (previously The Stolen Mirror),"(In order to avert a prophecy, a princess is confined to a tower or underground cave.) A prince in the form of a bird [D150] visits her three times and each time takes something away (jewelry, comb, mirror, hair ribbon). The princess becomes lovesick [T24.1] and goes to find the bird [H1385.5]. She learns (from an old man) where the bird has gone [H1233.1] and discovers that he can change into a handsome young man. She becomes pregnant by him and, in his mothers house, gives birth to a child. She learns (from him) how she can disenchant him. She fulfills the requirements (together with his mother) and he is disenchanted. Cf. Type 425E."
2058,434*,The Diver,"(Cola Pesce.) A man skilled in diving lives like a fish in the sea (and sometimes transforms himself into an ocean animal). The king summons him and orders him to go and report on various places under the water. The diver complies at first, but then he refuses to go to a particularly dangerous place. The king throws his crown into the sea [H1132.1.7], sending the diver on a quest from which he never returns. In an Estonian oikotype, the diver is in love with a princess. A jealous suitor tells her [H911] to throw a piece of jewelry into the sea for the diver to retrieve [cf. H1132.1.7]. The diver transforms himself into a duck and accomplishes this task [D161, D641]. He turns back into his human form [D700] and marries the princess [L161]."
2059,440,The Frog King or Iron Henry,"A young princess (youngest of three sisters) drops her golden ball into a well [C41.2], and a frog [B211.7.1] gives it back to her. (In some variants the frog helps her with some other difficulty.) He makes her promise him that he may eat from her plate, drink from her cup, and sleep in her bed [S215.1]. The animal comes for his reward and the king insists the princess do as she had promised. Angry, she throws the frog at the wall and he turns into a handsome prince [D789]. In some variants the frog is disenchanted by means of a kiss, marriage, from being decapitated, etc. [D735.1, D743, D711]. In the Grimms version: When the prince takes the princess home in his carriage, they meet his faithful servant Henry, whose heart had broken when the prince was enchanted. The iron bands that had held it together break from joy [F875]. In some variants the bride has the iron bands on her heart, and they break from pain, not from joy. After the disenchantment, both partners may be put to a test. The princess searches all over the world for her bridegroom, and he must identify his true bride. Cf. Types 313, 425A."
2060,441,Hans my Hedgehog,"A previously-childless couple (because of a hasty wish or a curse) have a son who is a hedgehog [C758.1, T554]. He becomes a swineherd in the forest, where the pigs thrive under his care. He gives directions to three (two) kings (merchant, count, king, one king three times, etc.) who have lost their way, and is promised one of their three daughters as his wife [S226]. Riding on a rooster, he goes to claim his bride three times. Two of the princesses refuse him and he scratches them, but the third agrees to marry him [B641.5]. On the wedding night (on the way to the church, after they have lived together), the animals skin is destroyed (the princess kisses the hedgehog, whips him, cuts off his head, etc.). The hedgehog is disenchanted and turns into a handsome young man [D721.3]. (The two other princesses kill themselves from jealousy and anger.) Cf. Types 425C, 433B."
2061,442,The Old Woman in the Forest (previously The Old Man in the Forest),"Robbers attack a group of travelers, and a poor servant girl survives by hiding in a tree. In the evening a dove brings her keys that unlock three trees in which she finds food, clothing, and a bed. The dove tells her to go to a little house where she will find an old woman. She should not answer any of her questions but should bring back a plain ring, leaving the shiny one there. The girl does as the dove ordered, and does not let the old woman distract her. She stops the old woman from running away with a bird cage, and finds the ring in the birds beak. While waiting for the dove, the girl puts the ring on her finger [D1076]. Immediately a tree envelops her with its branches and turns into a handsome young prince [D431.2] who explains that he had been enchanted by the witch. Other trees turn into servants and horses. The prince takes the girl to his kingdom, where they marry [L162]. Cf. Type 405."
2062,444*,Enchanted Prince Disenchanted,"(Including the previous Types 432*, 444A*, 444B*, 444D*, and 444E*.) Miscellaneous type. A prince is transformed (by a supernatural being) into an animal (monkey, fish, dragon, bird, cat, wild boar, etc.). He is disenchanted by a woman who sympathizes with him or helps him (by performing a task, obtaining a magic object, etc.)."
2063,449,Sidi Numan (previously The Tsars Dog [Sidi Numan]),"(Including the previous Type 1898*.) This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A man discovers that his wife eats corpses in the night. When he accuses her of this, she turns him into a dog. Another sorceress recognizes that the dog is really a human and returns him to his original form. With her help the husband is able to turn his wife into a mare and he beats her (to death). (2) An unfaithful wife turns her husband into a dog [D141, K1535], which herds sheep and also rescues the kings baby [D682.3]. When he returns to his wife, she turns him into a bird [D151.8]. He finds a magic wand, becomes a man again, and changes his wife and her lover into donkeys [D682.3]."
2064,400,The Man on a Quest for his Lost Wife,"(Including the previous Types 400*, 401, and 401A.) This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A man in distress (impoverished fisherman, merchant) unwittingly promises his (unborn) son to the devil [S240]. When the boy is delivered to him later, the devil cannot use him because he is protected by magic [K218.2] (cf. Type 810). Thus the boy is cast out in the sea (river, desert). He arrives in a foreign country and finds a lonely castle where he meets a bewitched princess (maiden, fairy) in the form of a serpent (deer). He rescues her by enduring three nights of torture [D758.1]. They marry [F302, L161]. When he wants to visit his parents, his wife gives him a ring to carry him home [D1470.1.15], and she forbids him to call her to come to him [C31.6] (to boast of her beauty [C31.5]). At home he is induced (by his mother) to break the taboo. His wife appears [D2074.2.3.1], takes the ring, and leaves him destitute. The man sets out in search of his wife [H1385.3]. On his way he meets three hermits (rulers of animal kingdoms, or moon, sun, and wind) whom he asks for directions [B221, H1232, H1235]. With the help of the third he arrives at the empire of his wife, or he pretends that he wants to help three giants who are fighting over magic objects (inheritance, booty). He steals the magic objects (magic sword [D1400.1.4], magic coat or hood [D1361.14], seven-league boots [D1521.1]) [D831, D832] (cf. Type 518). With their help he is able to overcome the obstacles on the way to his wife [D2121]. When he finds his wife, she is about to marry another man [N681]. He discloses his identity as her real husband. (2) Meeting the princess and disenchantment as in version (1); but the disenchantment is not complete. The princess wants to travel back to her own distant land. She asks her rescuer to wait for her at a certain time and place. She appears three times, but each time a servant (witch) has put her husband into a deep sleep from which he cannot be awakened [D1364.15, D1364.4.1, D1972]. The princess informs him (in a letter) how and where to find her ( on the glass mountain). The man sets out to find her. Continued as in version (1). (3) A youth watches a flock of birds (swans, ducks, geese, doves) land on the shore. The birds take off their feather coats and become beautiful maidens [D361.1]. While they are bathing, the youth steals the feather coat of the most beautiful girl, who cannot leave with the others and thus must marry the youth [D721.2, B652.1]. Later, because of carelessness (of the mans mother), the maiden takes back her coat [D361.1.1] and flies away (together with her children). She tells the youth her destination in the otherworld (e.g. glass mountain). The man sets out in search of his wife (as in version 1). Some variants include elements from Type 313 (Magic Flight)."
2065,401A*,The Soldiers in the Enchanted Castle,"Miscellaneous type. Twelve (seven, three) soldiers (deserters) come (often with the help of an animal or person) to a lonely castle (small house), where they receive food and lodging. A white woman (maiden who appears in a dream) asks them to stay in the castle for seven years (one year and two days) (to keep guard for three nights) and to fulfill certain conditions (not to think of a maiden, not to touch or look at the maidens who sleep in their beds, not to open a certain door). They disobey the prohibition and flee, or all (but one) leave the castle before the end of the vigil. Thus their efforts to disenchant the princesses who live in the castle are unsuccessful [D759.9]. The soldiers often return later, and the one is rewarded (often after having performed different tasks), but the others are killed. In some variants the soldiers succeed in disenchanting the princesses and each of them marries one of them (seven seven-year-old boys finally break the spell) [D759.10]."
2066,402,"The Animal Bride (previously The Mouse [Cat, Frog, etc","] as Bride). A father is not able to decide which of his (three) sons should inherit his property (kingdom) and sends them all on a quest for one year [H1210.1]. They are told to bring back a special object (yarn, linen [H1306], fine chain [H1303], ring, horse, smallest dog [H1307], money) or they must learn a profession. Whoever performs the task best will be the heir. The youngest son, often a fool, goes into a forest and becomes the servant of an animal (cat [B422], rat, frog [B493.1], mouse [B437.2]). As a payment he is given the object that his father had asked for. It proves to be the most beautiful one, and thus he should be the heir [H1242]. Because his brothers (parents) are envious, two further tasks are set, and finally the brothers are required to bring a bride (most beautiful woman [H1301.1]). The youngest returns to the animal which again promises to help. The animal is disenchanted by burning, mutilation, decapitation [D711], or by crossing a river [B313, D700], and becomes a beautiful princess with a castle. They return happily to his parents as bride and bridegroom. Sometimes they deceive the parents: The youngest son arrives dressed in rags and is ridiculed; then the bride arrives and they reveal their identities. When the son arrives in the first place dressed as a prince, a mole helps to identify him. Often the youngest son renounces his inheritance and goes with his wife back to her castle. In some variants from eastern and southeastern Europe and the Near East, the youngest son takes the animal (often a frog or toad) to his home and hides it from the family. The father assigns tasks to his daughters-in-law which the frog performs best. The last (third) task requires the brides to attend a feast, where the frog turns into the most beautiful woman. The bridegroom burns the frogs skin so that the bride cannot change back. As a consequence she leaves him, and he sets out on a quest and finally is able to retrieve her. Cf. Type 400."
2067,402*,"The Princess who Scorned an Unloved Suitor is turned into a frog (mouse, etc",")[T75.1, D661]. She is disenchanted (by another man) and her animal skin is burned in order to prevent her from changing back. Cf. Type 400."
2068,402A*,The Princess Transformed into a Toad,"A princess who has been transformed into a toad (old witch, etc.)is disenchanted by a young mans kiss (pity) and marries him. Cf. Type 440."
2069,403,The Black and the White Bride,"(Including the previous Types 403A and 403B.) A stepmother hates her stepchildren [S31]. The stepdaughter is kind to someone she meets (e.g. Christ and St. Peter) (she is sent after strawberries in winter [H1023.3], and meets dwarfs who help her). In return she is given great beauty [D1860] (the power of dropping gold or jewels from her mouth [D1454.2, D1454.1.2]). The stepmothers own daughter is unkind under these conditions and is made ugly [D1870] (made to drop toads from her mouth [M431.2]) [Q2]. The stepdaughters brother is in service at the court of a king. He takes his sisters picture with him. The king sees the girls picture, falls in love with her, and sends the brother for her [T11.2]. (The beautiful stepdaughter is seen accidentally by a king or prince, who marries her [N711, L162].) On their journey to the kings court, the stepmother or stepsister casts the true bride out of the carriage (overboard) [S432]. The king marries the ugly stepsister [K1911], and the brother is thrown into prison or a pit of snakes [Q465.1]. (The kings wife gives birth to a child. The stepmother throws her and her child into the water and substitutes her own daughter for the bride [K1911.1.2].) The true bride is transformed to a duck (goose) [D161.2], and comes to the kings court three times (to care for her child [D688]). The last night the king wakes and disenchants her by decapitation [D711] (cutting her golden belt, holding her during successive transformations [D712.4]). The brother, unharmed in the den of snakes [B848], is rescued. The true bride is married or reinstated, and the false bride and her mother are punished [Q261]. Cf. Types 450, 480, 510B, 511."
2070,403C,The Substituted Bride (previously The Witch Secretly Substitutes her own Daughter),"A witch secretly substitutes her own daughter for the bride. On the way to his home, the bridegroom discovers the substitution and throws the witchs daughter out of the carriage. The girl falls down to the earth (under a bridge), and from her navel grows a reed in which the witch recognizes her own daughter."
2071,404,The Blinded Bride,"(Previously Type 533* and part of Type 533.) A girl is blessed at birth by fairies (is kind to a snake) who cause her to produce gold (jewels, flowers) from her hands (mouth [D1454.2], footsteps [D1454.7], tears [D1454.4]). A king sees the girl and wants to marry her. Her wicked stepmother (aunt) and stepsister accompany her on the journey to the kings court. On the way, the girls stepmother feeds her with salty food. When the girl asks for water, the stepmother puts out both of her eyes [S165] or mutilates her. They take her clothes and throw her into the sea. The stepsister, posing as the bride, marries the king. A kind fisherman (poor man) finds the blinded girl, takes her home, and becomes rich from the gold from her hands. He uses the gold (jewels, flowers) to buy back the girls eyes [E781.2] (the snake commands this). The girl recovers her sight, dresses in beautiful clothes, and goes to the kings court. The king recognizes her when she washes her hands. He marries her, and the wicked women are burned. (The snake is the girls guardian angel and returns to heaven.)"
2072,405,Jorinde and Joringel,"The lovers Jorinde and Joringel accidentally go to the magic forest of a sorceress (witch). She transforms Jorinde, as she has many other girls before, into a bird [D683.2, D150] and keeps her in a cage. Joringel dreams about a magic flower, goes on a search, and finds it. He touches Jorinde and all the other birds with the flower and thus changes them back into their former shapes [D771]. Cf. Type 442."
2073,406,The Cannibal,"A couple have a child who is a cannibal [G33] who eats everyone up. A man succeeds in breaking the enchantment [D716], and the cannibal is transformed into a maiden [D11.1]. They are married [T101]. Cf. Types 307, 315A."
2074,407,The Girl as Flower,"(Including the previous Types 407A, 407B, 652A, and 702B*.) This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A girl (woman, fairy) has been transformed into a flower (twig, bush, tree, fruit) (transforms herself) [D212]. A man (her predestined lover) breaks a stalk and the flower changes back into a girl [D711.4] (he takes the girl in the form of a flower on a journey with him and transforms it afterwards). He marries her [T101] (sometimes her vegetable clothing has to be burned). Cf. Type 652. (2) After a hasty wish, a woman gives birth to a twig (bush, fruit) [T513, T555], plants it in a pot, and cares for it as for a child. A prince is irresistibly drawn to the plant and becomes love-sick [T24.1]. He obtains the plant. During the night a girl comes out of it, eats, and makes love with him. When the prince has to go to war, the girl stays in the plant. The prince attaches a bell to the plant which he will ring when he wants to call the girl. An envious woman (fiance) signals the girl to come. She appears and is killed, and her plant is destroyed. A compassionate woman resuscitates the girl [E0], and the rival is punished. (Previously Types 407A and 652A. Because of its structural similarity, also the previous Type 702B* is integrated here.) (3) A beautiful girl wants to have a lover, even if he is the devil (a dead man) [C15]. The devil comes in the form of an attractive man (with animal feet). She follows him and sees him eating corpses in a church [G20.1]. Several times she is asked whether she had seen anything. She denies this repeatedly, even when the devil kills her sister, mother, and father. At last she herself dies. Because she had made special arrangements for her funeral, the devil cannot find her. Cf. Types 363, 1476B. From her grave grows a beautiful flower (lily, rose, tulip) [E631.1] which only her predestined husband (nobleman, prince) is able to pick. Because she has to eat, at night she becomes a beautiful woman. Her husband takes her as his wife (often on the condition that he may not talk about her or present her in public, so that the devil will not be able to find her). The couple succeeds in tricking or killing the devil (the devil takes the woman to hell). (Previously Type 407B.)"
2075,408,The Three Oranges,"A prince insolently breaks an old womans jar (makes her angry in another way). She utters a curse: he is to fall in love with three oranges (lemons, other fruits, girls of magic origin) [S375]. The prince sets out on a (sometimes very long) quest during which he is given directions, advice, and help to overcome obstacles. The prince finds the fruits in a garden (castle). When he opens them, out of each comes a beautiful, often naked, young woman who asks for water (comb, mirror, towel, clothes, etc.)[D721.5]. The prince can give only the third woman what she asks for, and the other girls die (disappear, return into the fruits). The prince hides the woman on a tree besides a fountain while he goes to get clothes (carriage, company) for her. An ugly black woman (Gypsy woman, witch) comes to get water. She thinks that the reflection of the Orange Girl is her own [J1791.6.1], and breaks her water jar because she thinks she is too beautiful to carry water. The Orange Girl laughs, and the black woman discovers her. The black woman succeeds in taking the Orange Girls place (two different versions). The prince returns, and though he is astonished at the sudden change (excuses: sunburn, influences of wind and weather), he marries the false bride. (1) The black woman pushes the Orange Girl into the water [K1911.2.2], where she changes into a fish [D170] (bird [D150]). The false bride demands that it be killed, but from its remains grows a tree. She demands it be felled, but an old woman (man) takes away a splinter (log) [D610]. Out of this once again comes the Orange Girl, who secretly does the old womans housework. The old woman finds the girl and adopts her. The prince recognizes her when he hears her life history (when the girl tends one of his horses) [K1911.3]. (2) The black woman combs (louses) the Orange Girl and sticks a magic needle into her head. The girl changes into a dove [D150] and flies to the castle. The gardener (cook) hears the birds song asking about the prince and his black wife. The dove is captured and the prince is much pleased with it. He finds the magic needle and removes it, and thus the dove changes back into the Orange Girl [K1911.3]. Cf. Type 452B*. After the couples reunion, the false bride is punished (sentenced to a cruel death; she often pronounces her own judgment)."
2076,409,The Girl as Wolf,"An evil stepmother substitutes her own daughter for her married step daughter and transforms the stepdaughter into a wolf (lynx, fox) [D113.1], which hides in the forest. Every day the wolf comes, throws off her animal skin, and suckles her child (the child is brought to the forest). The childs father observes this, recognizes his beloved wife and (on the advice of a magician) burns her animal skin. Thus she is restored to human form [D721.3]. The stepmother and her daughter are executed [Q261]. Cf. Type 403."
2077,409A,The Girl as Goat,"(Including the previous Types 413A* and 413B*.) A childless woman wants a child even if it is only an animal. She bears a girl with an animal form (goat, jackdaw, pig, fish, etc.)[T554]. (An old woman finds a magic pumpkin which, at night, turns into a beautiful woman who cleans her house.) A youth (prince) observes the girl when she (while washing clothes, etc.)has removed her animal skin. He proposes to her and marries her [T111]. His mother disapproves of the marriage and torments the girl (who often plays a trick on her). Three times the girl appears at a festival in her human form, is admired, and dances. Twice she escapes and assumes her goat form. The third time the youth destroys the goat covering and disenchants the girl. Cf. Type 510A. In some variants, another young man decides to get married in the same way. But he is disappointed: his wife, a little pig, never changes into a girl."
2078,409A*,The Girl as Snake (previously Snake Princess is Disenchanted),"A snake which is pulled out of a fire turns into a woman and marries her rescuer. The husband promises never to call his wife snake. When he breaks this promise, the woman changes back into a snake and disappears (is once again delivered by her son-in-law)."
2079,409B*,The Promised Supernatural Wife (previously Child Weeping in his Mothers Womb is Promised Supernatural Wife),"An unborn boy who came into a womans womb by magic conception begins to weep [T575.1]. When someone promises him a supernatural being (fairy) as his wife, he stops crying and is willing to be born. The boy grows up very fast and sets out on a quest for the girl. With the help of supernatural beings he finds her. They marry [T111]."
2080,410,"Sleeping Beauty (Dornrschen, La bella addormentata",") (Announced by a frog [B211.7.1], B493.1) a daughter is born to a royal couple. A fairy (wise woman) who has not been invited to the celebration (baptism) utters a curse that the princess (on her 15th birthday) will die of a wound from a spindle (needle, fiber of flax) [F361.1.1, F316, G269.4, M341.2.13]. Another fairy changes the death sentence into a long (hundred-year) sleep [F316.1]. The king orders that every spindle (needle) in his empire be destroyed; but, because one of them has been overlooked, the prophecy is fulfilled [M370]: The girl meets an old woman who is spinning in a hidden chamber, pricks her finger with the spindle, and sinks, together with the whole court, into a magic sleep [D1364.17, D1960.3, F771.4.4, F771.4.7]. Around the castle grows a hedge of thorns [D1967.1] (the girl is enclosed in a tower). At the end of the appointed time, a youth (prince) breaks through the hedge [N711.2] and awakens the princess with a kiss [D735, D1978.5] (he impregnates her; she gives birth to two children, one of whom sucks the fiber out of her finger and thus disenchants her). In some variants the prince takes his wife and children to his family. During his absence the evil mother-in-law asks the cook to slaughter and roast the woman and the children. The cook disobeys, and the mother-in-law demands that the three be thrown into a tub full of poisonous toads and snakes. Unexpectedly the prince returns home, and the mother-in-law herself jumps into the tub."
2081,410*,The Petrified Kingdom,"A soldier comes to a kingdom where everything has been turned to stone. He spends three successive nights in a castle which is inhabited by evil spirits (devils), without succumbing to fear. All the kingdom revives, and the soldier marries the princess. Cf. Types 304, 307."
2082,411,The King and the Lamia,"A king sees a lovely girl who is actually a snake-woman [B29.1], falls in love, and marries her. Little by little the kings health deteriorates. A fakir tells him to feed his wife salty food and to stay up at night and watch her. The wife assumes her snake form and goes for water. An oven is heated red-hot and the snake is pushed in. A pebble is found in the ashes: Anything that it touches turns into gold [D1469.10.1]."
2083,412,The Maiden (Youth) with a Separable Soul in a Necklace,"Cf. Types 302, 403, 425. A maidens life depends upon her necklace [E711.4] which she must keep safe. She marries a prince. When a jealous girl (stepmother, stranger) steals the necklace, the bride seemingly dies and the jealous girl takes her place. The body of the seemingly dead woman is placed in a church (temple). She comes to life whenever her rival takes off the necklace. The prince finds the body of his wife and recovers the necklace (a son is born who recovers the necklace). The impostor is punished. In some variants, a prince whose soul is in a necklace [E711.4] seemingly dies when the necklace is stolen (by his stepmother). A woman marries the prince and recovers the necklace."
2084,413,The Stolen Clothing (previously Marriage by Stealing Clothing),"A youth comes upon a holy man (old woman) in the forest [N825]. He is told not to go in a certain direction, but when he does so [Z211], he sees three beautiful maidens bathing. The holy man agrees to help him, turns him into a bird, tells him to steal the clothes of one of the bathing girls [K1335], and warns him not to look back under any circumstances [C311]. The first time he does look back and is burned to a pile of ashes. The holy man restores him [E121.5], and the youth succeeds on his second attempt. Cf. Types 400, 408."
2085,300,The Dragon-Slayer,"A youth acquires (e.g. by exchange) three wonderful dogs [B421, B312.2]. He comes to a town where people are mourning and learns that once a year a (seven-headed) dragon [B11.2.3.1] demands a virgin as a sacrifice [B11.10, S262]. In the current year, the kings daughter has been chosen to be sacrificed, and the king offers her as a prize to her rescuer [T68.1]. The youth goes to the appointed place. While waiting to fight with the dragon, he falls into a magic sleep [D1975], during which the princess twists a ring (ribbons) into his hair; only one of her falling tears can awaken him [D1978.2]. Together with his dogs, the youth overcomes the dragon [B11.11, B524.1.1, R111.1.3]. He strikes off the dragons heads and cuts out the tongues (keeps the teeth) [H105.1]. The youth promises the princess to come back in one year (three years) and goes off. An impostor (e.g. the coachman) takes the dragons heads, forces the princess to name him as her rescuer [K1933], and claims her as his reward [K1932]. The princess asks her father to delay the wedding. Just as the princess is about to marry the impostor, the dragon-slayer returns. He sends his dogs to get some food from the kings table and is summoned to the wedding party [H151.2]. There the dragon-slayer proves he was the rescuer by showing the dragons tongues (teeth) [H83, H105.1]. The impostor is condemned to death, and the dragon-slayer marries the princess. Cf. Types 301, 303, 314, 315, 502, 530, 554."
