2150,369,The Youth on a Quest for his Lost Father,"A boy (young man) sets out to find his father who went away (disappeared) before his birth [H1381.2.2.1]. He comes to the house of an old woman (witch) and tricks her (kills her, wins a contest with her son). He finds his father (alive, dead, or transformed into an animal). The boy (a god) releases (resuscitates) his father."
2151,500,The Name of the Supernatural Helper,"(e.g. Tom Tit Tot, Rumpelstilzchen, Trillevip.) A father (mother) boasts that his daughter can spin gold or impossible amounts of yarn. Or, a mother beats her daughter because she is lazy. The king asks why and the mother says she will not stop spinning [H914]. The young womans talent is to be tested and she is shut in a room to spin [H1021.8, H1092]. If she fails she will die, but if she succeeds the king will marry her. She cries. A supernatural being (a little man) agrees to help her [D2183] if she will promise him her first child (herself) if she cannot guess his name [H521, S222, S222.1]. In some variants she has to remember his name after a long time. The young woman passes the test and the king marries her. After a year the little man, certain that she could not guess his name, comes back to take her child away. By chance the name is discovered (by a servant, the husband or the woman herself) when the little man sings it triumphantly in the forest [N475]. When the woman says the correct name to the helper he vanishes or sinks into the earth [C432.1]."
2152,500*,The Monster Reveals the Riddle,Students must count the peaks of a mountain range. They go to sleep. A monster watches them and thinks they are a multi-headed monster. He says that he walked through all the peaks of the mountain range (naming the number) and had never seen such a strange thing. Thus the students hear and solve the riddle. Cf. Type 1091.
2153,501,The Three Old Spinning Women (previously The Three Old Women Helpers),"Through a false boast of her mother [H914] or of a young woman herself [H915], she is compelled to spin an impossible amount of thread [H1092]. If she is successful a prince will marry her. She receives help from three old women who are deformed from too much spinning: the first has an enormous foot, the second has drooping lips, and the third has a thick thumb [G201.1, G244, D2183]. In payment she must invite them to her wedding. The prince sees them and exclaims in disgust. They tell him that their deformities come from spinning. He swears that he will never let his wife spin again."
2154,502,The Wild Man,"A king catches a wild man (Iron John) and puts him into a cage, forbidding anyone to set him free. His son frees the prisoner because his ball rolls into the cage or because he feels pity for him. The prince is afraid of his fathers anger and leaves home (his father drives him away to be killed or sends him to another king) along with a servant. On their way the servant persuades the prince to exchange clothes. The prince becomes a servant at the court of another king. At a tournament he appears unrecognized three times on a splendid horse [R222] which he received from the wild man and wins the hand of a princess. Or, he wins the princess because he has helped her father in war [L161]. Often the wild man is disenchanted [G671]. In some variants the prince works for a while at the wild mans house where he disobeys instructions (e.g. looks into a forbidden chamber [C611], cares for a horse although it is not allowed [B316]) and his hair turns to gold. Cf. Type 314."
2155,503,The Gifts of the Little People,"A hunchbacked man takes part in a dance of the witches or people from below the earth (elves, fairies, dwarfs) [F331.1]. He sings their song or adds a missing rhyme or more weekdays [F331.3, F331.4]. As a reward they remove his hump [F344.1] or give him gold [F342.1]. A greedy neighbor (hunchbacked person) wants to get the same reward, but he ruins the song or is unfriendly. The little people add the hump of the other man to his own, or give him coals instead of gold [J2415]. Cf. Type 480D*."
2156,505,The Grateful Dead,"(Including the previous Types 506506B, 506**, and 508.) One introductory episode is combined with various main parts in which a man wins a princess and a castle. The ending is also very similar. Introductory episode: While traveling, a man sees a corpse which is not allowed to be buried or is ill-treated by its creditors [Q271.1]. He uses all his money to pay the debts of the dead man and for his funeral. Later he meets the grateful dead man in the form of a traveling companion (old man, servant) who wants to help him [E341] on the condition that they will divide all their winnings [M241]. Cf. Type 507. Main parts: (1) The man ransoms a princess, who had been kidnapped, from slavery and marries her [R111.1.6, L161]. While the man is away in another country, the father of the princess recognizes the sail of the ship which is emboidered with the princess coat of arms and learns that his daughter is alive. When the man goes back to fetch his wife, he finds that she has been abducted by one of her fathers courtiers. The man searches for his wife, and the traveling companion helps him to return to his father-in-laws court [R163]. There the man discloses his identity as the husband of the princess and gets his bride back. (Previously Type 506A.) (2) The man rescues a young woman from robbers. On their way home by ship the man is thrown overboard by a rival [S142] but is rescued by the traveling companion [R163] and brought to the princess. He is recognized by means of a ring or otherwise [H94.4, H11.1]. The rival is unmasked and punished. (Previously Type 506B.) (3) The traveling companion equips the man with a magnificent horse. A tournament takes place in which the winner is to marry a princess [H972, H331.2]. The man wins her. (Previously Type 508.) Ending: The traveling companion asks for his part of the winnings and wants to divide the princess (their baby) [M241.1]. When the man, trying to save the princess, offers the whole kingdom, the traveling companion reveals himself as the grateful dead man, says his demand was only a test of faith, and vanishes. In some variants the grateful dead man is a saint, who helps the hero because he has redeemed a saints picture that was mistreated [N848.1]. (Previously Type 506**.)"
2157,506*,Prophecy Escaped,"A child is born in answer to a prayer [T548.1]. It is foreseen to the child that it will die by hanging when he is 20 years old [M341.1.4]. The child is helped by a companion (saint) who favours him because of his modesty. The companion saves the childs life and wins a princess for him. The helper demands half of the winnings, so the princess is to be divided [M241.1]. Cf. Type 934."
2158,507,The Monsters Bride,"(Including the previous Types 507A507C.) This type consists of one introductory part and two different main parts. The ending is often the same. Introductory part: While traveling a young man provides a suitable funeral for an unknown man whose corpse was mistreated by creditors [Q271.1]. Later he meets a traveling companion (servant) who wants to help him [E341] on the condition that they will divide all their winnings [M241]. Cf. Type 505. On their way, the traveling companion obtains (three) magic objects (e.g. boots, magic hood, cloak, sabre, feather). The young man woos a princess who is in love with a magician (ogre, devil). Her suitors have to guess her thoughts three times (bring hidden objects [H322.1], solve difficult tasks). If they fail they are executed. Main part: (1) With the help of the magic objects, the companion of the young man becomes invisible and follows the princess on her way to the magician. There he finds the solutions [H972]. He frees the princess by beating, burning, or killing the magician [T172.2.1]. On the wedding night the young man has to submerge the princess (in different forms) three times in a bath to release her from her enchantment [D766.1]. (Previously Type 507A.) Cf. Type 306. (2) All bridegrooms of a princess have perished during the bridal night [T172.0.1]. The young man marries her on advice of his companion. A snake (snakes) comes into the chamber or crawls out of the princess mouth to kill the young man, but the companion kills it. (Previously Types 507B, 507C.) Cf. Types 840, 1145. Ending: (After a year) the companion demands his half of the winnings and divides the princess in two parts. Snakes crawl out of her body. He puts the halves together and the princess is disenchanted forever. In a few variants the companion only pretents to divide the princess [M241.1] to test the faith of the young man, and then discloses his identity as the grateful dead man. Cf. Type 505."
2159,510,Cinderella and Peau dne,This type number refers to a cycle of related tales. See esp. Types 510A and 510B.
2160,510A,Cinderella,"(Cenerentola, Cendrillon, Aschenputtel.) A young woman is mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters [S31, L55] and has to live in the ashes as a servant. When the sisters and the stepmother go to a ball (church), they give Cinderella an impossible task (e.g. sorting peas from ashes), which she accomplishes with the help of birds [B450]. She obtains beautiful clothing from a supernatural being [D1050.1, N815] or a tree that grows on the grave of her deceased mother [D815.1, D842.1, E323.2] and goes unknown to the ball. A prince falls in love with her [N711.6, N711.4], but she has to leave the ball early [C761.3]. The same thing happens on the next evening, but on the third evening, she loses one of her shoes [R221, F823.2]. The prince will marry only the woman whom the shoe fits [H36.1]. The stepsisters cut pieces off their feet in order to make them fit into the shoe [K1911.3.3.1], but a bird calls attention to this deceit. Cinderella who had been first hidden from the prince, tries on the shoe and it fits her. The prince marries her."
2161,510B,"Peau dasne (previously The Dress of Gold, of Silver, and of Stars [Cap o Rushes])","(Cap oRushes, Donkey Skin, All Kinds of Fur, Allerleirauh.) A king promises his wife on her deathbed [M255] only to marry another woman who is as beautiful as she is (whom a particular ring fits). Because she is the only one who meets this condition, the king wants to marry his grown daughter. In order to delay the wedding, the young woman asks him to give her dresses like the sun (gold), the moon (silver), and stars (diamonds), and a coat made of many different kinds of fur (a covering of wood). After he provides all these, the daughter runs away from her father [T311.1] and, disguised in the ugly skin [K521.1, F821.1.3, F821.1.4], works as a kitchen maid (goose-girl) in another castle. Cf. Types 706, 706C. When a series of feasts is held in the castle where she works, the young woman secretly puts on her splendid dresses. The prince falls in love with her [N711.6] but does not recognize her as the kitchen maid [R255]. On the following days he treats the kitchen maid badly. During the feasts he asks the beautiful woman where she comes from, and she gives cryptic answers that refer to how he had treated the kitchen maid [H151.5]. He gives her a ring. Then the prince becomes lovesick. In her character as kitchen maid, she slips his ring into his soup (bread). He finds her [H94.2, H94.4] and marries her. Sometimes the young woman is discovered while she is bathing or dressing instead of being recognized through a token."
2162,510B*,The Princess in the Chest,"A widowed king wants to marry his daughter. She demands that he give her a magic golden chest (golden lantern). On their wedding day, she hides herself in the chest. The father sells the chest to a prince (it is cast into the sea, where a prince finds it and brings it into his house). When the princess secretly comes out and eats his food, he discovers her and falls in love with her. The princes fiance discovers the princess and sends her away. The prince becomes lovesick and the princess brings him food in which she has hidden a ring of the prince. He finds her and marries her."
2163,511,"One-Eye, Two-Eyes, Three-Eyes","(Including the previous Types 452C*, 511A, and 511A*.) A girl (boy) has a stepmother who does not give her enough to eat but makes her herd cattle and spin a great amount of flax. She tells her sorrows to a (little colored) cow (red ox, godmother), who gives her food [B535.0.1] and helps her with her work. The stepmother wants to know why the girl is so well fed, and sends her one-, two- and three-eyed daughters one after the other to find out. The girl sings One-Eye [F512.1] and Two-Eyes to sleep, so they learn nothing, but she forgets to sing to the third eye of Three-Eyes [F512.2.1.1], who tells her mother about the cow [D830.1]. The stepmother determines to have the cow slaughtered. When the girl tells the animal this, the cow tells her to plant its bones (intestines, or not to eat its meat). She does as she was told, and a tree (apple tree) grows which continues to help her [B100.1, D1461, D1470.2]. A rich man notices the tree and asks for an apple. When the stepsisters try to pick one, a branch scratches them. Only the girl herself can pick the fruit [D590, H31.12], and the rich man marries her [L162]. Often the tree goes (is taken) with them. The stepmother and stepsisters are punished. Sometimes, the child and the cow run away when the stepsister discovers their secret. They pass through brass, silver, and gold forests [F811.1]. In each forest, the cow warns the child not to pick the leaves [C513], but the child disobeys. A brass etc. ox (wolf, lion) comes and fights with the cow of the child. The last of these overcomes the cow, which, before it dies, tells the child to save (plant) some part of its body (horn, hoof, skin) because it will help him later [B505, B115]. (Previously Type 511A.) Or, the cow dies after the escape and turns into an angel that flies to heaven. (Previously Type 511A*.) In some variants another woman wants to marry the girls father. She promises to take good care of the girl and convinces her to kill her mother by having her look into a chest and dropping the lid on her neck. Cf. Type 720. In other variants, after the stepmother discovers the secret of the cow, she tries to kill the girl in a covered pit filled with burning coals. A dog warns the girl in front of the pit. The stepmother kills the dog and the next day the girl falls into the pit. She is burned up, the cow licks the ashes, and a duck comes out. When her brother comes home, the girl in the form of this duck tells him what happened. He punishes the stepmother. (Previously Type 452C*.)"
2164,513,The Extraordinary Companions,This type number refers to a cycle of related tales. See esp. Types 513A513B.
2165,513A,Six Go through the Whole World,"A discharged soldier (fool) acquires many (six) traveling companions with extraordinary abilities [F601]: e.g. one who runs fast [F681.1], one who eats great quantities [F632, F633], one who produces (can withstand) severe frost [D2144.1.2], one who can shoot and hit the left eye of a fly from far away [F661.5.3], one with acute hearing [F641.1, F641.2, F641.3], one who can make himself taller, and one who can rip up trees by their roots [F621]. In order to avenge himself on the king who discharged him, the soldier enters a contest to marry the princess [H331]. She has agreed to marry anyone who beats her at running [H331.5.1]. The king permits the soldier to employ his helpers. The runner overtakes the princess, but he falls asleep and is awakened just in time by the sharpshooter. In an effort to prevent the wedding, the king assigns other tasks: eating (drinking) a huge quantity [H1114, H1142], which the eater accomplishes, and staying in an oven [H1511], which the freezing man accomplishes. Finally the king offers the soldier as much money as he and his companions can carry [cf. H1127] if he will give up his claim for the princess. The companions ruin the king and overcome his army. The same motifs appear together in a reduced form. A prince (young man) is looking for a wife. He takes as servants men who help him accomplish tasks that have been set for suitors who hope to marry the princess [F605.2]. In the end he marries her [L161]."
2166,513B,The Land and Water Ship,"A king offers his daughter in marriage [H335, H331] to whoever can build a ship that can travel on land as well as in water [D1533.1.1]. Three brothers attempt this task, but the older two are unkind to an old man (little man) who asks what they want to do. The third who answers honestly gets help from the old man and is then able to build the ship (in one night) [N825.2]. The old man also tells him to take with him anyone whom he meets. These turn out to be men with unusual abilities [F601]. See Type 513A. When the young man brings the ship, the king is amazed, but since the young man is of humble origin, he gives him further (difficult) tasks to prevent the marriage. The young man accomplishes them all with the help of his companions [F601.2] (see Type 513A) and marries the princess [L161]."
2167,514,The Shift of Sex,"A king who has only (three) daughters must send a son to war (needs a son for other reasons). The daughters ask to be allowed to pretend to be men, but only the youngest passes tests which her father sets. He gives her magic objects (a horse) and she goes to the war. In some variants a queen has only daughters and, afraid of her husbands anger, pretends that the youngest is a boy. Or for other reasons a woman disguises herself as a man and goes out into the world. The woman in mans clothing [K1837] accomplishes heroic deeds and/or goes into service with a king. The daughter (sister) of the king falls in love with her and wants to marry her. The woman in mans clothing refuses, or the marriage is unconsumated. In order to get rid of the servant/husband, impossible tasks are set. The woman is able to accomplish these with the help of a helper (several helpers, the horse). Cf. Types 461, 465, 513A513C. In some variants the tests concern the gender of the servant, which had been doubted. For example, her manner of eating and her behavior in a garden are tested, or she is asked to bathe with the brothers of the princess. At the end of the tale, the woman in mans clothing is transformed into a man. This happens either through a demons curse [D11] or a saints help, seldom by accident. Then the princess is happy with her husband and the former woman becomes king. Her parents are happy that finally they have a real son."
2168,514**,A Young Woman Disguised as a Man is Wooed by the Queen (previously The Court Physician),"(Including the previous Types 881* and 884A.) A young woman in mans clothing [K1837] works as a doctor [K1825.1.2] (messenger) for a king. The kings wife falls in love with the doctor but is repulsed (accuses him of attempting to seduce or rape her [K2111]). Angry, she sets an impossible task, which the doctor must perform on pain of death. Often it is to enable a dumb person to speak. The dumb person reveals the intention of the queen, who is executed. The king marries the young woman who had posed as a doctor. Cf. Types 880, 881, 881A, and 884."
2169,515,The Shepherd Boy,"A foundling child who herds animals finds three objects (of glass) which he gives back to their owners. They promise to reward him [Q42]. With the help of the last owner, a giant, the boy fulfills three tasks. He acquires a castle in which a princess is confined. He rescues her and marries her [L161]."
2170,516,Faithful John,"A prince wants to marry a beautiful princess from a distant land because he heard her name, saw her picture [T11.2, T11.2.1], or saw her in a dream [T11.3]. A faithful servant (adoptive brother, a dead man whom he has redeemed [P361, P311, P273.1]) helps him in this pursuit. The servant poses as a merchant and traps the princess on a ship [K1332], or he enters her room by hiding in a statue of an animal [K1341] (in a magical manner). The princess is kidnapped or goes voluntarily. Cf. Type 854. On the way back, the helper overhears creatures (birds [B211.3, B143]) [N451] prophesy the future. They say that certain dangers that threaten the bridal couple can be averted by particular actions, but also that anyone who reveals this will be turned to stone. The dangers are a horse (other animal) that will run away with (kill) the bridegroom, poisoned food [H1515] (drink, clothing [H1516]), and a dragon who will kill the bridegroom on his wedding night [T172.2]. When the helper acts to avert the dangers, his actions appear excessive and irrational. When he kills the dragon, drops of its blood fall on the brides breast. He removes them (with his mouth, or he sucks them out of her body while she is unconscious). The prince construes this as a sexual attack and condemns the helper to death [N342.1]. Before the sentence can be carried out, he justifies himself [C423.4] and is turned to stone step by step [C961.2]. The prince and his wife mourn the helper. The prince discovers (in a dream) that he can bring his friend back to life by sacrificing his own children. He kills (injures) them and rubs the stone man with their blood [E113, D766.2, S268]. The helper is restored to life and he revives the children. Cf. Types 505, 507, and 916."
2171,516C,Amicus and Amelius (previously St,"James of Galicia). Two friends who look exactly alike assist each other in time of need. When one of them, in elder versions named Amelius, is challenged to a swordfight, the other, Amicus, who is a better swordsman, takes his place. Amelius remains behind with Amicuss wife, and puts a sword in the middle of the marriage bed at night [T351]. Amicus wins the fight for his friend. Later, Amicus contracts leprosy. An angel tells them that he will be healed if he bathes in the blood of Ameliuss children. Amelius cuts off their heads to save his friend [S268]. The children are restored to life. Or, because his mother had made a vow before his birth, a young man goes on a pilgrimage. He meets a friend through an apple test: a true friend is one who, when he shares an apple, takes the smaller half [H1558.0.1.1] (who notices that an apple is missing). When the friend is killed (very ill) and can be cured only by the blood of the children of the young man, he sacrifices his children in order to save his friend [S268]. The children are later restored to life. Cf. Types 303, 516."
2172,517,The Boy who Understands the Language of Birds (previously The Boy who Learned Many Things),"A boy who understands (has learned) the language of birds [B215.1, B216] is asked by his father to tell what he has heard. He is at first reluctant, but then repeats the birds prophecy [B143, M312.0.2] that the father will humble himself before the son (will serve him, bring water for the son to wash his hands). The father pushes the son into the sea (drives him out, tries to kill him) [M373]. The son is rescued and goes into the service of a foreign ruler. By hearing what birds say, he frees this ruler from ravens that annoy him. The son is honored and is given half the kingdom, and he marries a princess. In his new high position, he goes back to his parents, who serve him without recognizing him [N682]. Cf. Types 671, 671E*, 725, and 781."
2173,518,Men Fight over Magic Objects (previously Devils [Giants] Fight over Magic Objects),"A (young) man on a journey meets three (two) men (giants, devils), who are quarreling over the division of three magic objects (e.g. cloak of invisibility, seven mile boots, wishing hat, flying carpet) (which they have inherited). The man promises to render a judgment, but he asks first to try out the objects (to run a race against the owners). He takes the magic objects and runs away with them. He uses them later to accomplish difficult tasks [D832]."
2174,519,The Strong Woman as Bride (Brunhilde),"A prince falls in love with a powerful young woman who will marry only someone whose own power is as strong as hers. Suitors who try and fail are put to death. Although he is warned against it, the prince sets out along with a strong companion to win her [T58]. When they arrive, the helper storms the womans defenses, slays her army, and overcomes the woman herself on his masters behalf [Z3]. He defeats her in single combat (using a cloak of invisibility): e.g. in a shooting contest with a giant bow [H345.1], in breaking her wild horse [H345.2] [F601.2, H345]. On the wedding night the strong woman tries to crush the prince [T173.1]. The helper secretly takes his masters place and beats her for three nights with whips made of three kinds of metal [K1844.1]. When the woman discovers the impersonation, she orders the feet of the helper to be cut off [Q451.2, S162] and banishes the prince to the pigsty [K1816.6]. The helper finds a blind companion and together they force a demon to heal them with Water of Life [D1500.1.18]. The helper returns, overcomes (kills) the strong woman, and rescues the prince [R169.4]. 530559 Animals as Helpers"
2175,530,The Princess on the Glass Mountain,"(Including the previous Type 530B*.) A narrative in three parts with several different forms and combinations: (1) At night, a field (haystack, garden) belonging to a family with three sons is robbed (devastated). The sons keep watch. The elder two fall asleep (run away in fear), but the youngest (helped by a mouse, frog, old man) stays awake and captures three magic horses [H1471]. They promise to help him in the future, and he lets them go free [B315, B401, B181]. Or, hiding in a mound of hay, he is carried home by a giant. He kills the giant and finds his treasure (helpful spirits) and three horses [B315, B401, B181]. In some variants a dying father orders his sons to watch over his grave. Out of indifference (fear), the older brothers leave this task to the youngest [H1462]. At the grave he receives three horses, as well as a pipe (stick, bridle) to use to summon them. (2) The kings daughter is offered in marriage to whoever can ride to the top of a mountain (made of glass, crystal, marble) [F751, H331.1.1, H331.1.2] and/or take a golden apple from its summit. Or he must kiss the princess at the summit and take her ring or scarf [R111.2.2] In some variants he must jump up to the princess who sits at the window of the fourth story of a building [F1071] (and take her ring), or jump over a grave [F989.1, H331.1.3, H331.1.4]. The young man disguises himself and, with the help of the magic horses, succeeds three times. On the third time, the king (princess) gives him a token (marks him, he is injured). He goes away. (3) Messengers (king, princess) look for the champion, and/or all the men are ordered to march past the princess (the princess summons all the men to a feast). Through his token (mark, injury), the youth is discovered at home (in the kings household) [H80]. He marries the princess. In some variants the horses are disenchanted and become princes (princesses). Cf. Types 313, 314, 314A."
2176,530A,The Pig with the Golden Bristles,"A king commands his (three) sons-in-law to get magic animals: a pig with golden bristles, a golden-horned stag, wild boars from the sea, etc. The stupidest of the sons (another foolish boy) gets these wonders, but trades them to his brothers in return for their cut-off fingers and pieces of skin from their backs. At the feast where the brothers are honored, they are exposed as cheaters by the pieces of evidence shown by the fool."
2177,531,The Clever Horse (previously Ferdinand the True and Ferdinand the False),"(Including the previous Type 513C.) This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with a clever horse. The tale exists chiefly in three different forms, The Godchild of the King und the Unfaithful Companion, The Golden-haired Maiden, and The Clever Horse. A poor boy goes in search of his godfather [H1381.2.2.1], the king (God, Virgin Mary, etc.) [N811]. On the way he obtains a clever magic horse that offers to help him [B211.1.3, B133, B401]. Against the horses advice [B341] he picks up a glimmering feather (golden hair, golden horse-shoe, other bright object), which he later gives to the king. En route the boy is accompanied by a companion (devil, beardless man, Gypsy, etc.) who forces him to change places [K1934] and to swear silence. At the kings court the boy is employed as a groom. He helps different animals, who in return promise to help him [B350, B391, B470, B501]. A treacherous employee of the king (the boys companion) slanders him to the king, saying that he had boasted he could find the bird that had lost the feather and/or to bring the golden-haired maiden (princess) as bride for the king [T11.4.1, H75.2, H1213.1, H1381.3.1.1]. On pain of death he is assigned to accomplish the dangerous tasks [H911]. He succeeds with help of his horse. The abducted princess refuses to marry the old king until she receives certain things (her castle, keys that have fallen into the sea, water of life, etc.). The boy brings these with the help of his horse and of the helpers he had met on his way (grateful animals) [H982, B450]. As the last condition for the marriage the princess demands the boy be killed (burned, beheaded, dismembered, by taking a bath in boiling milk or oil of a herd of wild mares, by water of death, etc.) The horse saves the boy or he is resuscitated by the princess, rejuvenated, and beautified [E15.1, E12, D1865.1]. The king has the same thing done to him with fatal results (the princess does not resuscitate him, he dies in the milk, etc.) [J2411.1]. The magic horse turns into a young woman (man) [B313, D131, D700]. The boy marries her (the princess) and becomes king. Cf. Type 328."
2178,532*,The Magic Ox (previously Son of the Cow ),"(Gods Godson.) With the help of a (two, several) magic ox (cow), a boy plows the copper (iron, stone) field of the king. He marries the princess and receives (half of) the kingdom."
2179,533,The Speaking Horsehead,"A princess is sent to her fianc, a prince of a foreign country. Her mother orders a maidservant to accompany her, and gives her a small rag with some drops of her mothers blood to protect her and sends a speaking horse to take care of her. When during the journey the princess loses her mothers charm, the waiting-maid gains control of the princess [K2252, K1911.1.1], forces her to change clothes and roles [K1934], and to swear an oath of secrecy [K1933]. The prince unwittingly marries the maidservant, and the real princess is employed as a goose-girl [K1816.5]. When the false wife orders the horse to be killed [B335], the princess persuades a farmhand to hang the horsehead on the wall by a gate where she passes daily. Every day she greets the horsehead with a formula, and it answers regretting the injury that is being done to her [D1011, B133.3]. When she speaks a magic formula to make the hat of a goose-boy fly away (to keep an obstrusive goose-boy away from her), he complains to the king. Thereupon the old king starts observing her and finally makes her tell her life story to a stove [H13.2.7] (her dog [H13.1.2]) (cf. Types 870, 894). The truth comes to light, the real bride marries the prince, and the maidservant is punished (she unwittingly declares her own judgment). Cf. Types 403, 425A."
2180,535,The Boy Adopted by Tigers (Animals),A boy is abandoned in the forest and adopted by wild animals (tigers). He is given a magic bow and a magic arrow (axe). The animals arrange a marriage for him. A monkey (barber) takes his place. The boy goes to live with an old widow who has a lovely daughter. He proves his identity by using his magic objects. He marries both the girl to whom he was betrothed and the widows daughter.
2181,537,The Flight on the Grateful Eagle (previously The Marvelous Eagle Gives the Hero a Box),"A man aims his gun three times at an eagle. When suddenly the bird speaks like a human being [B211.3], the man spares it. The eagle has a broken wing and the man nurses the bird for several years until it recovers, spending all his wealth. The grateful bird [B380, Q45] carries the man on his back across the sea [B552] to his kingdom [B222]. On the way it frightens him three times by nearly dropping him into the sea (as the hunter had aimed three times at the bird). On the other side of the sea the eagles father (sister) gives the man a box [D1174.1], telling him not to open it before he reaches home [C321]. Overcome with curiosity, the man opens the box on the way, and a town (castle) springs out of it. In order to put the town back into the box, the man promises his (unborn) son to the devil (supernatural being) [S222]. The tale is usually an introduction to Type 313B."
2182,540,The Dog and the Sailor (previously The Dog in the Sea),"An unhappy sailor in misery tries to drown himself, but in the water (on shore) he meets a dog (poodle) who offers its help [B541.4]. On the dogs advice he takes it along with him to sea. After three heavy storms (several years) the dog orders the sailor to jump into the water. At the bottom of the sea he finds a castle and a beautiful woman. The dog had warned him of her seductive powers, so he kills her. Inside the castle the dog is waiting for him. After enduring three painful nights (after accomplishing special tasks), the sailor cuts off the dogs head, whereupon the prince who had once been enchanted by his mother-in-law (witch, father) is disenchanted [D711] and returns to human form."
2183,545,The Cat as Helper,This type refers to a cycle of related tales; it combines episodes from types 545A and 545B.
2184,545A,The Cat Castle,"A poor girl reaches the kings castle with the help of a cat (dog) [B211.1.8, B422, B421, B435.1, B581.1.2], (her sole inheritance [N411.1.1]). On the cats advice she pretends to be the princess of the castle of the cats. The prince falls in love with her (the royal couple receives her). When she looks out of the window and sees her parents quarreling of a pot of porridge, she laughs. Being asked why, she does not want to reveal her humble origin, so she pretends to have been laughing at the poor condition of the kings castle. The girls noble origin is tested. When she says she possesses a castle more beautiful than that of the king, she is asked to show it. The cat goes to the castle of a troll (giant, giantess) [F771.4.1] and kills him (by making him look into the sun). The girl becomes the owner of the castle and marries the king (guests are received: The cat demands to be killed by the girl and turns into a prince [D711]. He marries the girl) [B582.1.2]. Cf. Type 505."
2185,545A*,The Magic Castle,"(Including the previous Type 512*.) A poor girl gives all her food to an animal (cat, dog, fox) or to an old beggar (Christ). Afraid that her grandmother (mother, aunt) will punish her, she runs away and comes to a castle. (On the way, supernatural beings transform her adornments from flowers, snail shells, etc. into precious jewels.) She becomes queen. The grandmother comes and demands the food that she had given away. But the grandmother is pushed off the balcony (ladder), dies, and turns into a grapevine (tree), which continues to question the queen about the missing food. The queen laughs at this and her husband demands that she should explain why she laughed. She replies hastily that the toilet brush is more beautiful than his beard (her own castle or garment is more beautiful than his). The animal (supernatural being) helps her to prove this by giving her a bejeweled toilet brush (castle). In some variants a girl is cast out by her older sisters. On the advice of an old man, she goes to work in a castle. When the owners son asks to see the girls own castle, the old man helps her to produce one. (Previously Type 512*.)"
2186,545B,Puss in Boots,"An animal (cat [B211.1.8, B422], fox [B435.1], jackal [B435.2], monkey [B441.1], etc.) intends to help a poor man (out of obligation) to become rich (by marrying him to the princess) [B580, B581, B582.1.1]. In order to gain the emperors confidence, the animal tells him that the poor man is very wealthy [K1917.3]. When the poorly dressed future bridegroom travels to his brides residence, the animal simulates an accident (robbery), in which all his clothes (horses, bride presents, wedding guests) are lost [K1952.1.1]. Thereupon the king gives the poor man good clothes and he is accepted as a bridegroom. When the man has to display his property, the animal leaves before him and coerces the shepherds and farmers to say that their herds and farmland belong to the poor man. The animal kills the real owner of the properties, a demon (dragon, ogre, giant, witch, magician) by burning, slaying, shooting or through a trick [F771.4.1, K722]. When the bride arrives with her entourage, the bridegroom presents himself as the real owner of the property. The animal tests the gratitude of the poor man by feigning death (it becomes a human when it is decapitated [D711]). In some variants the man behaves ungrateful or does not keep his promise."
2187,545D*,The Pea King (previously The Bean King),"(Including the previous Type 545C*.) A poor boy finds a pea (bean) and imagines how many peas might grow from it. He goes to the king and asks for storehouses and sacks for his coming crops. The king is impressed and believes the boy is. He tests his noble origin by a bed-test (cf. Type 704). The boy is unable to sleep on the hard couch because he is worried about his lost pea. He marries the kings daughter. When the king wants to see the property of his son-in-law, the young man meets an ogre (devil, grateful ghost) who offers to give him his castle, but only if he can solve some riddles. The ogre tells all the farmers and shepherds on the way to pretend to be employees of the poor boy. An old man helps him solve the riddles. The ogre and his brothers burst, and the poor man becomes the owner of the castle and its land. Cf. Type 859."
2188,546,The Clever Parrot,The king wins the gratitude of a parrot who takes him to a princess (the parrot brings a princess to the king). On the return trip the king and his bride are separated. The parrot reunites them.
2189,550,"Bird, Horse and Princess (previously Search for the Golden Bird)","The type combines two different introductory episodes with a common main part. Introductory episodes: (1) Every night an unknown thief steals a golden apple [F813.1.1] from the kings tree. The two elder princes fall asleep when they watch for the thief, but the youngest is successful. He sees a golden bird [B102.1] and shoots one of its colored (golden) feathers [H1471]. (2) A sick king can only be healed by the singing of a golden bird. He orders a search for it [H1210.1, H1331.1, H1213, H1331.1.2, H1331.1.3]. Main part: The three brothers go on a quest for the golden bird. The first two meet a fox (wolf) which they intend to shoot. The fox warns them against going to a pleasant inn in the village, but they go there nevertheless. Both of them forget their father and the bird. The youngest son is kind to the fox, follows its advice, and finds the golden bird [L13, B313, B560, H1233.6]. Against the foxs advice he also takes its golden cage and thus wakes the guards. In order to save his life he has to go on a quest for a golden (magic) horse [B184.1]. Again, he also takes its golden bridle, so its guards awake, and he is condemned to death unless he brings a golden maiden (princess) [D961, N711.3, H1241, H1239.3]. With the foxs help [B435.1] he succeeds and finally reaches home with the golden princess, the golden horse, and the golden bird [H1242]. Against the foxs advice he releases his brothers from the gallows. They steal the bird, the horse, and the princess, and try to kill the youngest brother [W154.12.3]. They pretend to their father that they have brought him the valuable things [K1932]. The fox saves the life of the youngest brother (by using water of life). The golden bird, the horse, and the princess identify him as the man who rescued them. (He marries the princess [L161]) and his brothers are punished.) In some variants the king is healed by the birds singing. Cf. Type 551."
2190,551,Water of Life (previously The Sons on a Quest for a Wonderful Remedy for their Father),"A sick king can only be healed by a wonderful remedy [H1324, D1500.1.18] (water of life [H1321.2], rejuvenating apples, phoenix bird [H1331.1], etc.). Whoever brings it [H1210.1] will inherit the kingdom. His three sons go on a quest. The two elder haughty ones are diverted from their goal. The youngest is single-minded and friendly towards old men (dwarf, eagle) who show him the way and give advice. With their help he reaches a magic castle that opens only for one hour. He appeases the animal guards (dragon, etc.) and finds everyone else asleep. He locates the fountain of life (golden apple tree) and takes the remedy [H1242]. He sleeps with a beautiful woman (princess) [N711.3, T475.2] and leaves his name (identification token) with her [H81.1]. When he leaves the castle it closes (sinks). On his way back he rejuvenates (releases) the helpful old men and receives magic objects in return. At home his unsuccessful brothers secretly exchange a common (poisoned) remedy for his healing one [K2211, W154.12.3]. They give it to the king [K1932] and he recovers. These brothers slander the youngest and the king orders him to be killed. With the help of his magic objects he is able to escape this sentence. Meanwhile the beautiful woman in the magic castle has given birth to a boy and has discovered the name of the intruder. She arrives at the head of an army and demands the father of her son [H1381.2.1]. The haughty brothers pretend it is they. They accompany her, riding beside the golden cloth (path) which the princess has spread, but they find that the gate at its end is closed. The youngest brother appears in rags, rides down the middle of the golden cloth toward the castle (is recognized by his tokens), and the gate opens for him. He marries the woman [L161] and becomes the ruler of the kingdom. The old king learns what really happened."
2191,552,The Girls Who Married Animals,"(Including the previous Types 552A and 552B.) This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) Following the wish of his dead father and against his brothers advice, the youngest son marries his three sisters to the first suitors who come for them [S221.1]. The suitors take the girls home with them [B620.1, B640]. On a quest for his sisters, the brother reaches the castles of his brothers-in-law and learns that they are the masters of the three animal kingdoms (men transformed to animals [D620, D621.1]; cf. Type 302C*). They receive their brother-in-law in a friendly way and provide him with magic means (parts of their body, feathers, hair, etc.) [B501, B505.1] to use to call them at any time (he leaves a signal of distress). With their help he accomplishes difficult tasks and finally marries a woman (princess). (He is dismembered by an ogre, summons the brothers-in-law, and they resuscitate him; cf. Type 302C*. They also recover his lost castle; cf. Type 560). (Previously Type 552A.) (2) Three girls who despair of being married say that they will marry any one even if the suitors are animals [C26]. Three animals pass by and take along the three girls as wives. When the girls father visits his daughters, he finds food and other things magically provided by the brothers-in-law [D2105]. Later (at home) he tries the same method without success [J2411.3] (his effort nearly ends tragically). (Previously Type 552B.)"
2192,554,The Grateful Animals,"(Including the previous Types 553, 554*, 554A*C*, and 556A*E*.) This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with helpful deeds of grateful animals. In numerous tales the type occurs only as episode. Most of the variants present the following basic structure: A man while travelling meets three animals (from air, water and earth) who are in trouble. Because he rescues them, they promise to help him if needed. Later he falls in love with a princess whose father sets three impossible tasks for him to accomplish. With the help of the grateful animals he succeeds on three successive days [B582.2, H982, B571] and wins the princess. In some variants a part is added in which the man accompanies his elder brothers. When they try to injure some animals, he prevents them from doing so or compensates for their misdeeds and carelessness. When they trample on an ant-hill, he builds it up again, when they leave wounded animals, he takes care of them, etc."
2193,555,The Fisherman and his Wife,"A poor old fisherman rescues a supernatural being (magic fish [B170], other animal, divine being, saint, ogre, man in form of animal) from distress (danger of death, imprisonment, transformation). Or the fisherman puts a fish back into the water [B375.1]. In return the magic being grants him (and his wife) that all his wishes will be fulfilled [D1761.0.1]. In the beginning they profit only moderately, but later the wife becomes excessively demanding (e.g. they wish to become noblemen, kings, and finally even God himself). The fish (spirit) takes back his gift and the couple is returned to their former poor condition or punished in addition [C773.1, J514, Q338, L420] (transformed to animals)."
2194,556F*,The Shepherd in the Service of a Witch,"A father sends one of his three sons to tend the cattle (sheep, etc.) of a landlord who is a soothsayer (prince of sun, witch). When the boy drives the cattle to pasture, they suddenly disappear (in the forest, crossing a brook). He cannot follow them because he is confined in a tree (by a supernatural woman). After a while the cattle return, but he does not know where they have been or what they have eaten. Consequently he has not accomplished his task (and is punished). Then his brother tries, but he also loses the cattle. When the youngest brother tends the cattle, he succeeds with the help of the animals (the woman who had caught his brothers in the tree). By following the cattle, he learns that they transform themselves to women (daughters of the witch) during their absence. So he has accomplished his task [H1199.12.2]."
2195,559,Dungbeetle,"A (stupid, poor) boy (farmers son, smith, soldier, old man) buys various animals with special qualities (from a supernatural being): a mouse (rat), a (dung-) beetle, and a crayfish (ant, bee, cricket, louse, flea, lizard). Or he meets (finds) the animals on his way and takes them along. The king promises his melancholy daughter to any man who can make her laugh [T68, F591, H341, H1194]. The boy accomplishes this by means of the amusing actions of his animals (dancing, playing music) [H982, B571, B582.2]. But he is not accepted as a bridegroom and is thrown into a lions den. He is rescued by his animals, who also drive out the boys rival (prince) by their characteristic behaviors: The dungbeetle carries away the princes excrement [B482.2], the mouse makes him sneeze, etc. , or they torment him for three nights in such a way that he does not touch the princess but soils the bed instead. The king sends him away [T171] and the boy marries the princess [L161]. Cf. Types 571, 857."
