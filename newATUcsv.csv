80,1825B,Preaching as the Congregation Wishes (previously I Preach Gods Word,"). This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A congregation (master) requires that the clergyman preach an impromptu sermon on a text that has been placed in the pulpit. The page there is blank. The clergyman begins his sermon with the words, From nothing, God created the heavens and the earth. Sometimes he ends there. More often, the sermon that follows is considered a particularly good one. (2) A congregation complains that their clergyman, often a layman, knows no Latin. He goes to the sexton for advice. As they walk around, the sexton tells him some mock-Latin words which he makes by adding endings onto familiar words. The clergyman copies this formula in his next sermon, and the congregation is appeased [K1961.1.2]. Cf. Type 1628*. (3) An ignorant clergyman repeats the same words over and over, e.g. I preach the word of God; I am a good shepherd; or, Service and sermon. [K1961.1.2]."
81,1825C,The Sawed Pulpit,"This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A clergyman, often a layman, promises his congregation that they will witness a miracle. Secretly, he saws the pulpit almost through. When in his next sermon he refers to the miracle, the pulpit falls down [K1961.1.3]. (2) A clergyman (monk) gesticulates wildly during his sermons. One of the parishioners saws the pulpit almost through. It falls down during the next sermon, while the clergyman cites John XVI,16, A little while, and ye shall not see me. Cf. Type 1827. (3) A clergyman preaches standing on a barrel that caves in during the sermon."
82,1825D*,Fire in the Boots,"A clergyman, often a layman, serving mass tells his congregation to do as he does. By accident, coals fall out of the censer into his boots. He stamps his feet and then lies down on the floor and kicks. The parishioners imitate him. Cf. Type 1694."
83,1826,The Clergyman Has no Need to Preach,"A clergyman (often a layman, Nasreddin Hodja) asks his congregation whether they know what his sermon will be about. They do not know, so he berates them for their stupidity. He repeats his question the following week. This time they say they know, so he thinks he need not preach any more. The third week, the congregation is divided in their answer to the question: half say no and half say yes. The clergyman tells those who understand to teach the others [X452]. In some variants, a clergyman has to preach a sermon about a certain saint on the appropriate saints day. In order to avoid preaching this sermon, he announces that, since the saint performed no miracles that year, he need not give a sermon about him."
84,1826A*,The Saint who Ran Away (previously The Escaped Saint,") A saints picture is stolen from a church. The clergyman thinks that the saint ran away because he was a bad clergyman. Cf. Type 1572A*. In some variants, a clergyman and a sexton remove a saints statue. It is found in a bean field. The clergyman tells the congregation that it had gone to look for some food because they gave so little money for it."
85,1827,You Shall See me a Little While Longer,"A clergyman makes a bet with one member of his congregation that he will be able to empty a jug of wine during his sermon without being observed by the congregation (an alcoholic clergyman depends on his liquor to preach his sermon). In order to be able to drink behind the pulpit, he preaches on John 16.16, A little while, and ye shall not see me, and again a little while, and ye shall see me. After the sermon the clergyman shows the empty jug and asks if someone had lost it. Cf. Type 1825C. In some variants the clergyman goes behind the pulpit to drink during the prayers [X445.1]. Cf. Types 1533A, 1839B."
86,1827A,Cards (Liquor Bottle) Fall from the Sleeve of the Clergyman,"During his sermon, a clergyman drops playing cards (liquor flask) out of his sleeve (pocket). He asks the congregation (children) if they know what the cards are for. They show that they are well acquainted with cards. He replies that they know more about cards than they do about God (that on Judgment Day they will fall down just as the cards did). Cf. Types 1613, 1839B."
87,1827B,Billy goats instead of Sheep,"A clergyman preaches a sermon to his congregation, telling them that on Judgment Day when he stands before God (St. Peter at the gate of heaven), he will have to tell Him that, instead of faithful sheep, there were only billy goats (pigs, cattle) under his care (that none of them belong in heaven)."
88,1828,The Rooster at Church Crows,"During the service, a rooster flies into a church through an open window. He crows and wakes the sexton, who thinks it is his cue to answer part of the liturgy (sing a certain song) [X451]."
89,1828*,Weeping and Laughing,"A clergyman makes a bet that he can give a sermon that will cause half the congregation to laugh and half to weep. Or, a clergyman wants to show his bishop (the lord of the area) how badly his congregation behaves. He preaches a moving sermon that causes half his audience to weep. But he wears no trousers under his gown (he has fastened an animals tail to the seat of his trousers), so that the part of the audience that is behind him breaks out in laughter (the bishop is seated where he cannot see why the people are laughing) [X416]."
90,1829,Living Person Acts as Image of Saint [K1842],"This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) On a certain saints day, the saints statue is missing (it was broken during cleaning, sold, stolen). The sexton suggests to the clergyman that a shoemaker (tailor, beggar) who happens to look like the statue should stand in its place. The shoemaker agrees. Before the end of the service, however, he has to move (he sneezes or has to urinate, is bothered by insects, burns his foot on a candle). Often he curses. The statues coming to life is said to be a miracle. (2) A woodcarver who is supposed to carve a saints statue does not finish it on time. He finds someone who looks like the statue to take its place. A representative from the church comes and asks the woodcarver to alter the statue with a knife. The person taking its place becomes frightened and runs away. Cf. Types 1347, 1359C, 1572A*, and 1730."
91,1830,Producing the Weather (previously In Trial Sermon the Parson Promises the Laymen the Kind of Weather they Want),"A congregation needs to appoint a new clergyman (sexton). They choose one who says he can produce whatever weather that they want. However, they cannot agree what the weather should be: one group wants rain, and another, sunshine. The new clergyman suggests that they let God decide what the weather should be (that it should be the same with the weather as it was before) [J1041.1]. Cf. Type 752B."
92,1831,The Clergyman and Sexton at Mass,"A clergyman tells his sexton (deacon) that he should steal a sheep (hog) during the service. When the sexton returns, the service is still going on. The clergyman asks him, as if it were part of the liturgy, whether his theft was successful. The sexton replies, also as if it were part of the service, that he got the sheep (that his theft was discovered), but that he lost the clergymans horse. Or, other dialogs on other subjects are incorporated into the liturgy, e.g. between the clergyman and his cook or between the sexton and the clergyman [X441]."
93,1831A*,Inappropriate Actions in Church,"(Including the previous Type 1831A.) This miscellaneous type consists of various anecdotes in which people in church act in inappropriate ways because of ignorance. Or, the clergyman (clergyman and sexton) acts in unsuitable ways, e.g. fighting, ordering alcohol (for cooking), misunderstanding Latin phrases. Cf. Type 1678**."
94,1831B,The Clergymans Share and the Sextons,"During the sermon, the clergyman asks the sexton if anyone is coming. The sexton answers that a man carrying a wheel (cudgel) on his shoulder is coming. The clergyman says that the sexton may have the wheel. The sexton then sees a man coming carrying half a hog (an old woman with a tub of butter). The clergyman says he will keep that for himself [J1269.1]."
95,1831C,The Clergyman Takes a Bribe,"A man named Secula boasts to his rich neighbor Micula (Matila, Picula) that he is named in the church service when the clergyman sings, Saecula saeculorum. The neighbor offers nine sheep to the clergyman if he will sing in micula micolorum instead. The organist (sexton) points out the mistake, so the clergyman gives him one of the sheep."
96,1832,The Sermon about the Rich Man,"A rich man lets a boy ride to church with him in his coach. The boy accidentally leaves his coat (wooden shoe) behind in the coach. The clergyman preaches about a rich man who went to hell. The boy calls out in dismay, He took my coat with him! [X435.5]."
97,1832*,The Boy Answers the Clergyman,"(Including the previous Types 1832A*, 1832C*, 1832G**, 1832H*, 1832J*, 1832K*, and 1835C*.) This miscellaneous type consists of various anecdotes in which the clergyman questions a boy during the service (in the street). The boy gives a quick-witted answer (which leaves the clergyman speechless). Cf. Type 1810."
98,1832B*,What Kind of Dung A clergyman (man) sees a boy on the road who is looking at something,"The boy says he does not know what it is, and the clergyman tells him that it is horses dung (a horseshoe). The boy replies that he was wondering whether it was the dung of a horse or of a mare. Cf. Type 1225A."
99,1832D*,How Many Sacraments Are There (Including the previous Type 1810A*,") A clergyman asks a boy (servant girl) how many sacraments (gods) there are. The boy does not know, so he asks in return if the clergyman knows how many teeth a rake has (how much cloth can be made from a certain amount of flax, how to braid a straw hat). The clergyman does not know the answer, and the boy tells him that one person cannot know everything. To the question of the number of gods, a member of the congregation (farmer, child) answers a number that is too high. The clergyman refuses to continue with the persons confirmation (sends the person home). The candidate repeats the question to another person who tells him that there is only one God. The candidate cannot believe that the clergyman would want so small a number as this for the answer. (Previously Type 1810A*.)"
100,1832E*,Good Manners,"A boy brings a cheese (other item) to a clergyman (merchant, lawyer). The clergyman thinks that the boy did not act politely, so he exchanges their roles in order to teach him how to behave. The clergyman makes a polite speech as he gives the boy the cheese. The boy thanks him and reaches into his pocket for money to give him a generous tip."
101,1832F*,Invitation to Dinner (previously Boy Invited to Dinner by Priest),"A boy (farmer) is invited to a meal (by some students or a clergyman). A whole turkey (suckling pig) is served. The host warns the boy that whatever he does to the turkey, the host will do to him. The boy thinks for a while and then puts his finger in the animals rear to draw out the stuffing (and licks his finger)."
102,1832M*,Clergymans Words Repeated,"A clergyman (sexton) has smudges on his glasses (he has forgotten to bring them) so he cannot read the liturgy during mass. He absent-mindedly sings out about his handicap and the congregation repeats his words as usual. The clergyman tries to correct their mistaken response, but the congregation repeats that too. Or, the clergyman chooses a man to help with the service. The man thinks he has to repeat everything that the clergyman says, so he repeats the clergymans questions about what his name is and where he comes from [J2498.2]. Cf. Types 1246, 1694, 1694A, and 1821."
103,1832N*,Lamb of God Becomes Sheep of God,"A man (boy, farmer, shepherd) comes to confession but does not know any prayers. The clergyman teaches him a short prayer that begins with the words, Lamb of God. Later the clergyman asks the man if he still remembers the prayer. The man begins with the words, Sheep of God. The clergyman asks why the man changed the word, and the man answers that the animal must have grown up in the meantime. In Arabian variants, the man is asked for his astrological sign and he answers, Goat (Ram). When he is asked to explain, he says that he was born in the sign of the Kid, but surely it must be grown up by now [J2212.6]."
104,1832P*,The Devil! (Including the previous Type 1810C*,") The clergyman asks a boy in the confirmation class, Who is the worst enemy of mankind The boy does not know the answer. For some other reason, another boy curses, The devil! The clergyman recognizes this as the right answer. Or, a clergyman asks a question of a stupid person (asks him to read something). The person mumbles something about a fish. This is the right answer, and the person is praised for his intelligence. (Previously Type 1810C*.)"
105,1832Q*,A Clergyman Asks for the Way,"A clergyman asks a boy the way to the next village. He also warns the boy not to smoke, or he will not go to heaven. The boy replies that if the clergyman knows the way to heaven, he must surely know the way to the next village."
106,1832R*,Hymnbook Upside Down,"A person in church who cannot read holds his (her) hymnbook upside down. When the person beside him tries to correct him, the man with the book explains that he is left-handed [J1746]. Cf. Type 1331*."
107,1832S*,Church of Dung,"Boys are playing in the dung (with mud). The clergyman asks them what they are making. One boy answers, A church.

108,1832T*,Who Was the Father of Noahs Sons A foolish farmer (young man) wants to become a sexton (teacher),"Among other questions, the clergyman (landlord) asks him, Who was the father of Noahs sons The farmer cannot answer this question and tells his wife about it. She wants to help him and asks him, Who is the father of our millers sons Our miller. Now the fool believes he knows the right answer. He goes back to the clergyman and says to him, The father of Noahs sons is our miller. [J2713]."
109,1833,The Clergymans Rhetorical Question Misunderstood (previously Application of the Sermon),"(Including the previous Type 1833**.) This miscellaneous type consists of various anecdotes in which a person (who arrives late to church) thinks that he has to answer a rhetorical question posed by the clergyman during the sermon [X435]. For example in some (German) variants, during the Easter service, the clergyman asks about the disciples on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24,13): Who were these two who went there Someone in the congregation thinks he is asking about two men on the village street and answers, Two butchers. Or, the clergyman warns against dying while drunk, because such a person will be buried drunk and be drunk still on Judgment Day. A listener remarks that it must be powerful wine, since it makes one drunk for so long [cf. J1321.1]."
110,1833A,"What Does David Say A clergyman sends his servant to buy something from the butcher David (Paul, Moses)","The servant returns to the church just as the clergyman asks in his sermon, What does David say The servant thinks the question is addressed to him and replies, He says you must pay your old debt first. [X435.1]."
111,1833B,Where Is the Father (previously Where Did Our Father Stay),"A clergyman asks a boy (man) who the personages in the Trinity are (asks someone how he crosses himself or how he has baptized his child). The boy answers, God the Son (Father) and the Holy Ghost (In the name of the Father and the Holy Ghost.). The clergyman asks where the father (son) is, and the boy tells him where his own father is, e.g. holding the oxen (calf) or at home by the stove mending his clothes [X435.2]."
112,1833C,"Where Was Christ when he Was Neither in Heaven nor on Earth The clergyman asks where Christ was, when he was neither in heaven nor on earth (he asks, what does God do)","The answer is, he was looking for a good stick (getting a whip ready) to beat the person who asks such questions [X435.3]. Cf. Type 1738."
113,1833D,The Names of the Persons of the Holy Trinity,"(Including the previous Type 1832G*.) A clergyman wants to teach a boy (shepherd, cowherd) the names of the persons of the Holy Trinity (a prayer). To help him, the boy is to associate the names with three (four) animals (buttons on his jacket). Later, when the clergyman meets the boy and asks for the names, the boy cannot remember them all because one of the animals died (was sold, one of the buttons fell off) [X435.4]. Or, a farmer is supposed to associate the names of the Holy Trinity with members of his family, father, son, and wife. He refuses to do so because he is certain that the Holy Ghost is not such a spendthrift. Asked how many persons constitute the Holy Trinity and who they are, a boy answers, Four. He counts God the Father, his Son, the Holy Ghost, and Amen. (Previously Type 1832G*.)"
114,1833E,God Is Dead (previously God Died for You),"An old woman (other member of the congregation, child) hears from the clergyman (other person) that Christ died for our sins (God is dead). She says she is sorry for the death, and that she did not know of it because she lives so far out in the country that she never gets any news. Then the old woman wonders about who Gods successor will be."
115,1833F,The Same Old Story,"This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A man goes to church on Good Friday (Christmas Eve) and hears the sermon. The next year, he goes again on that day (his son goes forty years later) and hears the same sermon. He complains that they are telling the same old story over again. (2) In Jewish variants, an old woman is so affected by the story of Joseph and his brothers that she stops eating and becomes ill. A year later she is recovered. She goes to the synagogue and hears the same text. She decides not to fall ill a second time."
116,1833H,The Large Loaves,"This miscellaneous tale exists chiefly in four different forms: (1) A clergyman preaches about the miracle of the loaves and fishes, when 5000 people were fed with seven loaves and two fish. The congregation doubts whether this is possible. The clergyman explains that the loaves were as big as mountains (houses). The people ask how big the ovens were [X434.1]. Cf. Type 1960K. (2) A clergyman reverses the number of loaves and people by mistake. Someone in the audience says that he could do that too. The following year, the clergyman gets it right and asks the congregation if they could do that. Someone says yes, because there would be leftovers from the previous year. (3) A clergyman says that God made the world in six months. He is corrected by the congregation but sticks to what he had said. (4) In variants from eastern Europe, a clergyman says that God made Adam out of clay and put him on a fence to dry. Someone in the congregation asks where the fence came from, since no one was there to have made it."
117,1833J,"Abraham, What Do You Have on Your Breast A man named Abraham (Joseph), on his way to church, steals a ham (pair of ducks) and hides it under his jacket","In his sermon, the clergyman asks rhetorically what Abraham has on his breast (repeats rhetorically, I can see you).

120,1833M,The Long Sermon,"A clergyman is so preoccupied with his long sermon that he does not notice that his congregation is becoming restless. Little by little, all the people leave. Finally the sexton gives the key to the clergyman, and tells him to lock up when he is finished."
121,1834,The Clergyman with the Fine Voice,"A clergyman notices that when he sings (preaches), an old woman starts to cry. He thinks his singing is affecting her deeply and so he sings more forcefully. After the service he asks her why she was crying. She answers that his voice (beard, face) reminded her of her recently-dead goat (donkey) [X436]. In some variants the woman answers that the clergyman reminds her of her son who is studying theology. She is crying because it is such a waste of money [cf. X426]."

126,1835B*,The Pasted Bible Leaves,"During the service, a clergyman reads directly from the Bible. Two pages stick together (he turns two pages by accident) so he is suddenly in the middle of another story and reads an absurd sentence. Or, the clergymans hymnbook drops from the pulpit. He can sing only, La-la-la."
127,1835D*,Wager: Clergyman to Read Prayer Without Thinking of Anything Else,"A man (St. Bernard) promises a clergyman (chattering woman, hermit, man) a horse (pig) if he can say a prayer (the Lords prayer) without thinking of anything else.

132,1838,The Hog in Church,"A sexton accidentally locks a hog in the church. He hears a noise and alerts the clergyman, who puts on his vestments, takes the Bible, and asks the sexton to open the church door. The hog runs between the clergymans legs and hurries away with him riding on his back. The clergyman thinks he is being taken away by the devil [X415]. Cf. Type 1849*."

He writes, If he does not live, let him die, on a piece of paper which he puts in a bag and tells her to hang it around the animals neck [K115.1]. The calf recovers. Some time later, the student comes again to the village as a clergyman (teacher). He becomes ill, and the villagers recommend an old woman who is known for her ability to cure the sick. She gives him a little bag to hang around his neck. Inside the bag he finds his own message, and he laughs so hard that he recovers [N641] [J1513.1]."

Instead, the clergyman hits him back, quoting [Matthew 5,39], With the measure you use, it will be measured to you, and even more. [J1262.3]. In some variants there are witnesses to the fight who say that both men are interpreting the Bible. Or, the fight is between a gentleman and a clergyman. The gentleman hits the clergyman with a stick, saying, This is Moses staff, with which he drew water out of the rock. The clergyman draws a pistol and says, This is Aarons holy censer.[J1446]. Cf.

A clergyman (Nasreddin Hodja) who cannot read the calendar puts beans (peas, grains of corn, pumpkin seeds) into his jacket pocket corresponding to the number of days in Lent (Ramadan). Each day he removes (eats) one bean (throws it in a pot). His wife (daughter) finds the beans and, thinking her husband likes them to eat, adds another handful. When the clergyman is asked how many more fast days there are, he counts the beans in his pocket and names an absurdly big number (says that Easter will not come this year; or, he finds colored eggshells and says that Easter is here already) [J2466.2]. Or, a clergyman makes a broom (wheel; collects a single egg) each day of the week so that he will know when Sunday comes. When he has six brooms, he tells the sexton to ring the bells on the following day.

In some variants from southeast Europe, a clergyman sits on the back of an unruly cow while his wife (farmhand) milks it. The cow runs away with the clergyman. Others ask him where he is going, and he replies, Only God and this stupid cow know! [J2132.3]. Cf. Type 1838."

He is about to throw a chest in which the lover is hiding into water or to throw it down the stairs (he lets the lover free in return for a ransom). The lover hides in the calfs stall and the servant drives him out with a whip. The wife wants to bring food outdoors to her lover, whose whereabouts she thinks she can locate by following certain signs along the way. The servant manages to alter the signs (e.g. he puts cloth on a horse to change its color) so that the wife brings the food to him instead [K1571]. The wife sends the servant to take food to her lover (to invite him to a meal). The servant drops the food on the way and tells the lover that the husband has discovered the adultery. On his way back, he tells the farmer that the lover has refused to come. Or, he says that the lover wants the farmer to help him repair his broken plow [K1573]. When the lover sees the farmer collecting the food strewn along the way, he thinks he is coming with the tools or going to attack him, so he runs away. Meanwhile, the servant has told the wife that her husband knows about her adultery, so she runs away. He tells the farmer that she left because her village (house) burned down. Or that she had promised always to cook food just as good as she did today if her husband can catch up with her. The farmer immediately goes after her. (Cf. Type 1741.)

The child tells his father (the father becomes suspicious), who teaches him another song. On Sunday, the clergyman announces from the pulpit, What this child sings is true. The child sings, The clergyman has slept with my mother (all the women in the village). [K1631]. (Or, All the children with red hair belong to the clergyman cf. Type 1805*).

160,1736B,The Firm Belief,"King Friedrich II of Prussia asks a soldier what he believes. The soldier says he believes what the shoemaker believes. The king asks what that is, and the soldier explains that he owes the shoemaker for a pair of boots but the shoemaker believes he will not be paid for them. The soldier also believes this.

The workman does not know what intelligence means. To explain it, the foreman holds his hand up in front of a tree and tells the workman to hit it. Right before the man hits his hand, he pulls it down, and the workman smashes his hand into the tree. The comment is, Thats intelligence. The workman returns, and asked by the other one he explains that the foreman got intelligence. His companion does not know the word either. So the first man holds his hand up in front of his face and invites his companion to hit it. He pulls his hand down and takes the blow right in his face. In some variants, a nobleman explains to a stupid farmer what a joke is (Irishman shows his companion a Yankee trick)."

The giant throws a stone high into the air and the tailor throws his bird [K18.3] (cf. Type 1062). The giant orders the tailor to help him carry a tree out of the forest, so the tailor takes the top end and rides in the branches [K71] (cf. Type 1052). Using various tricks, he accomplishes other feats ([K1112] cf. Type 1051; [K63] cf. Type 1061; [K18.2] cf. Type 1063; [K72] cf. Type 1082; [K61] cf. Type 1085; [K525.1] cf. Type 1115).

The tailor uses tricks to accomplish the tasks. After the tailor marries the princess, he accidentally (by speaking of needle and thread, or in his sleep) discloses his humble origin [H38.2.1]. The king sends his soldiers to take back the tailors kingdom. The tailor pretends to be asleep and brags about his heroic deeds [K1951.3].

When servants enter the room (at the end of the three days), he says, That is the first (second, third). The servants believe he has discovered their theft, and admit to having stolen the ring [N611.1]. To prove his power, he must say what is inside a covered dish (closed fist). He has no idea and bemoans, Poor Crab (Cricket, Rat)! He is lucky that this is the right answer [N688]. He gives a purgative to a person whose horse had been stolen. When the person has to go outside, he discovers his missing horse [K1956.1]. Or Dr. Know-All hides the horse himself and then discovers it [K1956.2]. In variants from northern Europe, he becomes a clergyman. He impresses the local farmers with his short and incomprehensible sermons (when his pulpit suddenly collapses, because it had been sawed through. Cf. Type 1825C [K1961.1.3])."
380,1641A,Sham Physician Pretends to Diagnose Entirely from Urinanalysis,"A man posing as a physician claims to be able to diagnose by examining the patients urine. He actually depends on his own observations and makes inferences from trifling details [K1955.2]. Cf. Types 1739, 1862C."

387,1642,The Good Bargain,"This anecdote is comprised of various motifs and episodes from other humorous tales. A foolish farmer performs various senseless actions that turn out to be to his advantage: Because he misunderstands the croaking of frogs, he throws money into the pond for them to count [JI851.1.1]. He sells meat to a dog, expecting it to carry it to the butcher [JI852]. Or, he puts goods to be sold to a signpost [J1853, J1853.1]. When he returns for his money and does not receive it, he complains to the king (takes the dog to court) and thus causes the melancholy princess to laugh [H341] (cf. Type 559). He declines to marry her and is offered a different reward, which he promises to a guard (soldier) and a Jew. The king orders a beating instead of money, and the Jew receives the blows [K187] (cf. Type 1610) (cf. Type 1689A). The Jew takes the farmer to court, loaning him his coat (boots). At the trial, the farmer denies that he has borrowed the coat and thus renders the Jews testimony unbelievable (makes the Jew appear to be insane) [J1151.2] (cf. Type 1642A)."

He sells the cloth (cow, other goods) to a statue (crucifix) because it does not speak, and says he will come back the next day for the money. His mother is dismayed when being told at her sons stupid bargain. When he goes back to get the money, the cloth has been stolen and the statue will not speak. Angry, the son throws a stone at the statue. It breaks and inside is a pot of money (treasure) which he mistakes for beans [J1853.1.1, N510]. Cf. Type 1696."
390,1644,The Early Pupil,"An old man (farmer, workman, father) decides (is advised) to go to school (because he thinks it will make him rich).

391,1645,The Treasure at Home,"A man dreams that he finds a treasure on a bridge in a distant city. He goes to find it but is unsuccessful. While he is there, he tells his dream to a man (beggar), who in turn relates a similar dream in which he found a treasure in the house of the first man. When the first man returns home, he finds the treasure there [N531.1]. Cf. Type 834."
392,1645A,Dream of Treasure Bought,"(Guntram). A king falls asleep under a tree. A servant observes an animal creep out of his mouth [E721, E730], run to a stream, and try to cross it. The servant lays his sword across the stream, and the animal runs over it and into an opening in a mountain. Later the animal goes back into the mouth of the sleeping king. The king awakes and relates that he dreamed that he went over a stream on an iron bridge and entered a mountain where he found a great treasure. The servant tells the king what he had observed. The king looks into the mountain and discovers the great treasure, which he donates to the church. In many variants, someone else buys the dream and then finds the treasure [N531.3]."
393,1645B,Dream of Marking the Treasure,"A man dreams that he finds a treasure (is told where a treasure is buried). It is too heavy for him to carry so he marks the place with his own excrement. In the morning he finds that only the end of this dream was true: he has defecated in his bed [X31]. Cf. Type 1407A*. In later European variants, a man (farmer, gambler, rich man, poor man, miser, clergyman, fool, married couple) lights a candle to the devil (saint) (cf. Type 778*). That night he dreams that the devil took him to a place where a treasure was buried. The devil tells him to mark the place with his excrement. Again, only the end of the dream is true."

Type 545B) and something else (musical instrument, scythe [N411.2.1], rake, flail, winnowing shovel, hammer, millstone, ax, etc.). This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) Each son takes his inheritance to a foreign country where it is unknown and sells it there for a fortune [N411]. A king buys the rooster because he thinks that it makes the sun rise. Fools who had used awls to harvest their grain pay generously for the scythe (cf. Types 1202, 1203, and 1203A) [N411.2]. The cat is sold at a high price in a country plagued by rats where cats were unknown (cf. Types 1281, 1651). Or, the inhabitants flee because they are afraid that the cat will devour everything, not just the rats. (2) The brothers turn their inheritance into riches by some other means. For example, the millstone falls down onto robbers who are counting their treasure; the robbers flee leaving the money behind (cf. Type 1653). Or, one brother who has inherited a rope uses it by the shore to make sandals. The devil comes out of the water and asks what he is doing, and he replies that he is making a trap for the devil (to tie the lake together). The devil offers him gold in exchange for the rope (cf. Type 1045). Or, one of the brother inherits a musical instrument (fiddle) that makes wolves dance. He is given money when he threatens to let the enchanted wolves go free (to call them back) (cf. Type 1652)."
396,1651,Whittingtons Cat,"A youth (man, merchant, poor woman) buys a cat and gives it to a merchant (gentleman) to take away on his ship (caravan) and sell (the owner himself takes it on a journey). The cat is taken to a country (island, Africa, India) where there are no cats. This country is so overrun with mice (rats, snakes) that the inhabitants cannot sleep for fear of being bitten; or, while eating, they have to defend themselves from the animals attacks with cudgels and hammers. The man demonstrates the cats ability to hunt and sells it for a high price. (The cat returns to him twice, so he is able to sell it three times.) The merchant intends not to give the money to the cats owner, but a storm (miracle) convinces him to be honest. The young man who was the cats original owner marries the merchants daughter (a princess in the foreign land) [N411.1]. Cf. Types 1281, 1650."

400,1653,The Robbers under the Tree,"(Including the previous Types 1653AF.) This tale exists chiefly in five different forms: (1) Travelers (a single traveler) in need of a place to spend the night climb a tree. While they are hidden in the branches, robbers (rich people) settle under the tree to count their booty (to have a feast). The people in the tree overhear the activity below and let something (e.g. a door, cf. Type 1009) fall (accidentally). It lands on the robbers, frightening them so that they flee and leave their valuables behind. The travelers keep the booty and thus become rich [K335.1.1]. Cf. Types 1009, 1650, and 1875. (2) On leaving home, a husband tells his wife (wife tells her husband, mother tells her son) to mind (shut or lock) the door, but instead she takes it with her [K1413]. At night they climb a tree. The door falls, frightening robbers who flee and leave their booty behind [K335.1.1.1]. (3) Two (more) brothers exclude their youngest brother from their thieving expeditions because they think he is a fool. In order to get his own wealth, he climbs a tree, taking a door (corpse, millstone) along with him. He lets it fall on robbers who have gathered under the tree. They run away, leaving their booty behind [K335.1.1.1, K335.1.2.1]. (Previously Types 1653B and 1653C.) Cf. Types 326B*, 1525R.

(Previously Type 1653F.)"
401,1654,The Robbers in the Death Chamber,"Two farmers (friends, poor people) disagree about a bargain (found money): one thinks he has been cheated and wants to get even, or they try to cheat each other. When the creditor demands payment (that the contract be fulfilled), the debtor pretends to be dead. He is taken to the church (temple, tomb; buried in a grave) where the creditor holds a vigil. During the night, robbers come by to divide their booty. The seemingly-dead man sits up suddenly and cries out, Get up, all you dead people! The creditor replies, Here we are! The robbers, thinking the dead are coming out after them, flee. The creditor and the debtor share their wealth [K335.1.2.2]."
402,1655,The Profitable Exchange,"A poor man finds a bean (pea, grain of millet) which is eaten by a rooster. The old woman who owns the rooster gives it to the man. When the rooster is eaten by a pig, he is given the pig. A steer (cow) kills the pig, and he takes the steer as compensation. Similarly, the man is given a horse as compensation for the steer [K251.1]. Cf. Type 170. Eventually he demands a woman (princess) as compensation and puts her into a sack. His luck turns: strangers set her free and replace her with a big dog who jumps out and attacks the man [K526]."
403,1656,How the Jews Were Lured Out of Heaven [X611],"This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) In heaven, St. Peter announces that a favorite food (drink) is available elsewhere.

When he meets the first hunchbacked person and explains the situation, it happens that the man is also of that name and from that city (suffers also from the other handicaps). The poet demands more money from him as he reveals each of these circumstances, but the hunchbacked man refuses to pay [N635, J2225]."
407,1663,Dividing Five Eggs Equally between Two Men and One Woman,"A king sets a task: five eggs must be divided among one woman and two men in such a way that each has three eggs. A clever woman solves the problem: each man gets one, because he already has two [testicles], and she herself takes the remaining three [J1249.1]. In some variants, a father gives three eggs to his three daughters. Whichever of them best multiplies her eggs will be the first to marry. The oldest gives one to her father, saying, You already have two, so that makes three. She gives one to her mother, saying, In the night, when father gives you his two eggs, you will also have three. I will keep one for myself, and when I am married I will have three eggs. Neither of her sisters is able to give so clever an answer, so she is the first to marry. Cf. Type 1533B."

He disguises himself as an old woman (beggar) and gives liquor (a drug) to the farmhands (guards, soldiers) to make them sleep [K332]. (2) He steals the bedcover (shirt) and wedding ring of the earls wife [H1151.3, H1151.4]. He contrives that the earl shoots a corpse (straw man) and goes to bury the body. The thief tells the earls wife that the earl needs the blanket and ring for the corpse [K362.2]. (3) He traps the priest and the sexton in a sack (cf. Type 1737) and puts candles on the backs of crabs. The men take him for an angel and the lights for wandering souls (cf. Type 1740). He carries the sack to the goose house (hangs it in the bell tower or chimney). Cf. Type 1737. After these tests, the master thief is banished from the country (pardoned, rewarded). Cf. Type 328."
412,1525B,The Horse Stolen,"This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A thief pretends to show how a horse can be stolen, but actually he steals the horse himself. In some variants something else is stolen (shoes, clothing, a watch, dishes, purse, meat, etc.) [K341.8]. Cf. Types 1540, 1542. (2) In a German version the horse is stolen in a different way. A rider meets a poor beggar who asks him to retrieve his crutch, which a prankster (bad boy) had hung up in a tree. When the rider climbs the tree, the pretended cripple jumps on his horse and rides away."
413,1525C,Fishing in the Street (previously The Traveler Watches the Man Fishing in the Street),"A traveler (travelers) watches a man fishing in the street. The companions of the fisherman meanwhile rob the travelers wagon [K341.11]. Cf. Types 1382, 1525N*."
414,1525D,Theft by Distracting Attention,"A master thief (apprentice) steals an ox (ram) of a farmer (farmhand) who is going to market. The thief drops first one, then the other, of a pair of matched objects (shoes, boots, sword and sheath, knife and fork) in the road [K341.6]. The farmer passes by the first object but, when he sees the second, he goes back for the first, leaving his animal behind. The thief takes the animal. Other tricks are also used to distract the farmers attention: the master thief pretends to hang himself in the forest [K341.3] (pretends to be dead). Or he imitates the cry of the farmers animal [K341.7] or sets a rabbit (chicken) free. In other variants one of the thieves takes the bell off a sheep that is following a donkey. He ties the bell to the donkeys tail and steals the sheep. A second thief steals the donkey by offering to take care of it while the owner goes to look for his missing sheep."

Or a new member of a band of robbers has to demonstrate his skill and outdoes his teacher [L142.1]. Cf. Type 700. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) One thief steals an egg out of a birds nest without disturbing the bird. A second thief steals the same egg from the breast (pants pocket) of the first, or steals the trousers (shoe soles) off him while he climbs up to get the egg. Or the first thief takes off his cloth in order to get the egg, and the second thief steals the cloth. (Previously Type 1525H1.) Cf. Type 653. (2) Two thieves steal a ham (butchered hog, goat) from the wife of a former member of their band. This man steals the ham from them, and finally they steal it back again [K306.1]. (Previously Type 1525H2, 1525H3.) (3) Two thieves trick each other. First, they exchange supposedly-valuable sacks which turn out to contain only worthless things (sand, hay, etc.) [J1516]. Next, they exchange jobs (tending an unmanageable cow, carrying water in a leaky pot, etc.) because each thinks the others work is easier, and both come to grief [J2431.1, K1687]. Together they find (steal) a treasure and each tries to trick the other out of his share. One hides in a chest, and the other, believing it to be full of gold, carries it home [K307.1]. (Previously Type 1525N.)"

He pulls the hair of one of them, who gets angry at his companion for bothering him. Then the boy pulls the hair of the other thief, who also blames his companion. The boy continues this until the thieves put down the hive to fight each other. In some variants the boy (man) does not bother the thieves. They take the hive and build a fire under it.

The nephew (apprentice thief) wants to keep all the meat for himself. He takes the hide to a waterhole. Hiding in the bushes, he beats the hide as if he himself were being beaten. He cries and shouts that it was not he but his uncle who stole the ox. The uncle thinks that the boy has been caught, so he runs away [K335.1.3]. In some variants the thieves cut the tail (head) off the ox (sheep) and stick it in the mouth (backside) of another, so that it looks as if one ox has eaten the other. Or they put the severed part in a swamp [K404.1]. When the owner swims out to get his drowned animal, they steal his clothes. Cf. Type 1004. (2) A boy (woman) tells a passing thief (soldier) that he has lost a silver cup (pail, etc.) in the well (river), and asks him to get it back for him.

Type 1531."
429,1526A,Supper Won by a Trick,"Three (four) tricksters (thieves, students, soldiers) want some supper. They have no money, so they obtain their food through (three) successive tricks. Usually someone else has to pay for their food. In some variants a single trickster gets a free meal through one of various tricks, e.g. by pretending that he is an invited guest [K455.1, K455.2, K455.4]. Cf. Type 1920E."
430,1526A**,Waiting until the Tower Falls,"Two men (students, farmhands) in an inn look out of the window and see that the churchtower is lopsided.

433,1527A,The Robber Disarmed (previously Robber Induced to Waste his Ammunition),"This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A boy in the forest comes upon a robber who takes his sword and robs him. The boy asks the robber to cut off his hand, to make it appear that the boy had fought to defend himself. When the robber swings the sword, the boy pulls his hand back and the sword becomes stuck in a tree trunk. The boy pulls the sword out and kills the robber [K630]. (2) A robber attacks a farmer (merchant) and takes his money. The victim asks the robber to shoot his hat (clothes) so that it will appear that the robber had to use considerable force. When the robber has used up all his ammunition, the farmer chases him away with his stick [K724]."
434,1528,Holding Down the Hat,"This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A merchant is chasing a thief who stole from him. Disguised as a farmer, the thief stands by the side of the road pretending to be guarding a valuable falcon which he has hidden under his hat. When the merchant comes by, the farmer offers to chase the thief, if the merchant will guard the falcon and lend him his horse. The merchant pays him for helping, and the thief keeps the horse in addition. Cf. Type 1540. (2) A man defecates by the side of a road and covers the pile with his hat. When a priest comes by, the man explains that he has caught a beautiful bird. He sells the bird to the priest with the condition that he should not pick up the hat until the man is out of sight.

He leaves his companion in place of the stolen animal. The companion convinces the owner (farmer, minister, pilgrim) that he had been turned into the animal as a punishment for his sins (for cursing his father or mother). The period of his punishment is now over and he has become human again [K403]. The owner of the animal believes this and lets him go free (and often apologizes for having beaten or insulted him, and gives him hospitality or money). The owner goes to buy a new donkey at the market, where he finds his old animal. Believing that this is his acquaintance, the owner reproaches him for having sinned again, and refuses to buy the animal."
436,1529A*,The Exchange of Horses,"This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A gentleman agrees to exchange his good horse for the poor horse of a farmer, provided the farmer will eat its dung. The farmer does so and discovers valuables in the dung. (2) A gentleman (Englishman) agrees to give a farmer (Russian) a cow (his fortune) if the farmer will eat a frog. The farmer succeeds in eating half, and offers the other half to the gentleman to eat if he wants to keep the cow (the Russian fulfills the condition but the Englishman cannot; so he does not get back his fortune)."

440,1531,Lord for a Day (previously The Man Thinks he has Been in Heaven),"A rich man (ruler) orders that a drunken farmer (a merchant who has been drugged into sleep) be brought into his house. He dresses him in fine clothes and feeds him well (and lets him perform the rich mans duties). After a day (an hour, three years) the farmer is taken in his sleep back to his old house. He thinks he has been in heaven (has dreamed it all. He is no longer satisfied with his old position) [J2322]. Cf. Types 944, 1313A*, 1526."
441,1532,The Voice from the Grave,"Two swindlers hear of a wealthy man who has died recently. One of them takes the dead mans place and is buried (hides near the grave). The other finds the relatives of the dead man and tells them that the man had borrowed a large amount of money from him. Asking that they repay the money, he suggests that they verify the debt by asking the dead man.

The swindler who takes the money goes away, leaving his confederate still buried in the ground. Cf. Type 1676."
442,1533,The Wise Carving of the Fowl [H601],"This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A poor man (farmer, clever man) brings his master (ruler) a chicken (dove, goose, etc.) as a present. The master asks him to divide the bird appropriately among the members of his household. The poor man gives the master the head and his wife the neck, because the head and the neck belong together (the wife the rump, because she sits at home, or the heart). He gives the two sons the legs, because they work outside the house to support the household, and the two daughters the wings, because they will fly away. He takes the body for himself. The master rewards him well for his wisdom. Cf. Type 875. Sometimes the tale continues: A neighbor hears of the poor mans good fortune. He brings the master a present of five chickens along with rice. When he is asked to divide these appropriately he cannot do so, and he is beaten. (2) Sometimes as a conclusion to the version above: A master asks the poor man to divide (these) five chickens (other birds) among the members of his household. The poor man gives the master and his wife one bird, to make three. Likewise he gives one to the two sons and one to the two daughters. Finally he takes the last two for himself, to make another set of three. Cf. Type 1663."
443,1533A,Hogs Head Divided According to Scripture,"A clergyman, a sexton, and a schoolmaster (three students) want to divide a roasted pig (a pigs head) among themselves. The criterion for the division is their skill in quoting Scripture. The minister cuts off an ear and says, So Peter cut off an ear from the servant of the high priest. The sexton cuts the head off the pig (the second ear) and says, So was the head of John the Baptist cut off (and they gave him a box on the ear). The schoolmaster considers for a long time. Finally he spreads a cloth and puts the rest of the pig (head) on it and says, And then they took the holy body away. [J1242.1]. In some variants, three monks find a single egg and agree that it should go to the one who gives the most appropriate quote from the Bible. The first says, Purify it from the shell of falsehood. The second says, Sprinkle it with the salt of wisdom. The third says, Come in to praise the Lord! and eats the egg. Cf. Type 1626."
444,1533B,The Third Egg,"A farmers son who is studying philosophy (medicine) has returned home. One day two eggs (fowls, pancakes) are served for dinner. In order to show off his education, he explains that these are not two but three: This is one, that makes two, and together they are three. His father refrains from contradicting him. He takes one egg for himself, gives the second to his wife, and invites his son to eat the third egg [J1539.2]."
445,1533C,The Clever Division of the Herd,"A man (farmer, Turk, Arab) leaves his three sons (nephews, farmhands) a total of 17 cows (horses, camels, coins) to be divided as follows: the oldest son is to have half; the middle son, one third; and the youngest, one ninth. They are unable to solve this problem until a bystander adds one of his own animals to the herd. From 18 animals, each son can take his proper inheritance, and then the bystander takes his own animal back [J1249]."
446,1534,Series of Clever Unjust Decisions,"(The Decisions of Shemjaka.) A poor man (merchant, baker) causes a series of accidents: He pulls off the tail of a (borrowed) horse (one of two oxen that he has borrowed dies). The owner sues him. The poor man flees into a house and frightens (hits) a pregnant woman so that she miscarries. Or a woman invites him in out of the rain, and he sits on her sofa and accidentally kills her child. Her husband (the woman) sues him as well. Out of desperation, the poor man jumps from a high tower (bridge) and kills a passer-by [N320, N330], whose brother (other relative) sues him. The injured parties bring the poor man before a judge. The judge decides as follows [J1173]: The poor man should keep the borrowed horse until its tail grows back. He should impregnate the mother with another child (and her husband should hit her again, to give her another miscarriage). Her husband rejects this settlement and withdraws his suit. (In some variants, he has to pay a fine to the poor man.) The brother (other relative) of the killed man should jump from the tower upon the poor man in order to kill him. He also withdraws his suit. (In some variants he also has to pay a fine to the poor man.). (The poor man leaves with the horse and his settlements.) Some variants have a frame tale: The judge persuades a baker (merchant) to give him a goose (duck) that belongs to someone else. He promises to protect him if the owner of the goose accuses him of theft. Then as above. Cf. Types 926C."
447,1534A,The Innocent Man Condemned to Death (previously The Innocent Man Chosen to Fit the Stake [Noose]),"A holy man and his disciple come to a city where the king and all his ministers are fools, and where all kinds of food are sold for the same price [J342.1.1, X1503.3]. The holy man leaves at once and warns his disciple to do so too, but the disciple stays despite the warning [N347.7]. A thief tries to break into a house at night but is killed when the wall collapses (he puts his eye out on a projecting stick). The householder is called before the king and sentenced to death (to have his eye put out). The householder, however, blames the mason who built the wall who, in turn, blames the man who supplied the mortar, etc. , until finally one man is found who is too stupid to find someone else to blame. He is condemned to death [J2233]. The owner explains that he needs both his eyes for his work, but his neighbor, who is a hunter, needs only one. The hunter says he really needs both eyes, but his neighbor, who is a musician, always closes his eyes when he plays, etc. The king decrees that one of his eyes be put out. Cf. Type 978. The condemned man is too thin to fit the stake (noose). The disciple is chosen to be executed in his place [N178.2]. The holy man returns and announces that he has discovered that the next man to be executed will go directly to heaven [K841.1, J1189.3]. The king leaps upon the stake himself [K842.4, K843]. Cf. Type 980*."
448,1534A*,Barber Substituted for Smith at Execution,"A smith commits a crime and is condemned to death. The villagers complain to the judge (mayor) that they cannot manage without the smith. They ask him to execute a barber instead, because they have two of those [J2233.1.1]."
449,1534D*,Sham Dumb Man Wins Suit,"A trickster (farmer) (carrying a tall tree) calls to a (rich) man to get out of the way. The man refuses and the trickster overturns his wagon (tears his clothes). The rich man brings him before a magistrate. The trickster pretends to be mute (is too afraid to speak). The angry plaintif protests that the man is not dumb, and that he had given him a loud warning. Thus the plaintif loses his case, because he did not heed the mans warning [K1656]."
450,1534E*,Good Decision,"Two men bring their argument before a judge. The judge hears one side of the case and decides that it is right. Then he hears the other side and decides that it too is right. When someone complains that both sides cannot be right, the judge says, You are right too."
451,1534Z*,Other Absurd Decisions,(Including the previous Types 1534B* and 1534C*.) Miscellaneous type with diverse variants.
452,1535,The Rich and the Poor Farmer,"(Unibos.) This tale often begins with one of the following episodes: (1) The family of a poor man (farmer) kills their only cow (two oxen) and uses all their flour to bake bread. They invite all the villagers to a big dinner. The family waits in vain for a return invitation from the guests. (2) A rich man kills his poor brothers only horse, and gives him its skin. Main part: The poor man goes to the city to sell the cowhide (oxhide, horsehide). During the night he discovers the innkeepers wife with her lover and threatens to expose them. They bribe him not to tell. Or, a merchant believes that the poor mans sacks of refuse contain valuables. The merchant takes the sacks, and in return leaves his goods for the poor man. Back at home, the poor man tells his rich brother (the villagers) that he received all the money for the animal hide (the refuse). The brother (villagers) kills all his cattle in order to sell their hides, and impoverishes himself (tries to sell refuse and is beaten). In some variants the rich man is angry and tries to kill his brother, but instead he kills an old relative (dead man) who is lying in his place in bed. The poor man takes the corpse away, and convinces an innocent man that he killed the person. This man bribes the poor man not to tell. Then the poor man claims that he had sold the corpse. Cf. Types 1536C, 1537. The rich man kills all his relatives, hoping to sell their corpses. He is put in prison and set free after he serves his sentence. Still angry, he tries to drown his brother. The poor brother, confined in a sack (chest), finds a passer-by (shepherd, rich lord) who is willing to trade places with him. After this person has been thrown into the water, the poor man comes back to the village with the sheep (horse, riches) and claims he found them under the water. The jealous rich man (the villagers) jumps into the water and drowns. Cf. Types 1539, 1737."
453,1536,Disposing of the Corpse,The motif of having to get rid of a corpse [K2151] appears in a series of different narratives. It has different results depending on its situation in the tale. This type combines episodes particularly from types 1536A and 1537.
454,1536A,The Woman in the Chest,"A poor brother (neighbor, sexton) steals a hog (cow, food) from his rich brother (neighbor, clergyman). The rich man suspects his brother, but wants to be certain, so he hides his mother-in-law (mother, wife, cook) in a chest (cupboard) in his brothers house to spy. Cf. Type 1360C. The woman confirms the rich mans suspicion and cries out (curses, makes noise). The poor brother opens the chest, strangles the woman (kills her in some other way), and puts some food (cheese, meat, sausage, bread) in her mouth. The rich brother opens the chest, sees that the woman is dead, and thinks she has suffocated. He wants to keep her death secret and bribes the poor brother not to tell any one and to bury her. Later, the poor brother digs her up at night (keeping some of her valuables) and sets her body at his brothers door, where it falls over when the door is opened in the morning. The rich brother thinks the corpse has returned to haunt him [K2151, K2321]. Cf. Type 1537. He pays his poor brother more money to bury the corpse again (often three or four times), but it turns up in the barn, close to the well, on a foal that follows the rich man, etc. The poor man gets so much money (cattle, provisions) for reburying the body that he becomes as rich as (richer than) his brother."
455,1536B,The Three Hunchback Brothers Drowned,"There are two parts to this tale. The first part exists in two forms, but the second part is largely the same. (1) Three hunchbacked musicians are asked by the wife of another hunchbacked man to play some music. (One of the three hunchbacked brothers marries a rich widow, and his poor brothers visit her uninvited.) The husband unexpectedly comes home. The musicians hide in a chest (oven, cellar), where they die [N320] (kill each other). (2) Three monks (clergymen, knights, students) court a beautiful woman. On the advice of her husband, she invites them to visit her. The visit of the first lover is interrupted by that of the second, etc. , and they hide in a chest (oven, cellar). The third lover hides when the husband arrives. The husband kills them in their hiding place [K1551.1]. Cf. Type 1730. A drunken man (stupid farmhand, farmer, porter, undertaker, beggar, soldier, the devil) is employed to dump one of the dead bodies into the river (to bury it). When he returns, he finds the second body in the same place as if it had come back from the dead, and then the third. After he gets rid of all three bodies, he meets the hunchbacked husband (another monk, clergyman, knight) and, thinking that this is another revenant, kills him and dumps him into the river (buries him) also. Cf. Type 1537."
456,1536C,The Murdered Lover,"A woman wants to meet her lover without her husbands knowledge. She asks a neighbor (God, saint) for advice, and is told (by her husband hiding in the church or behind the saints picture) that she should give her husband a particular food that will make him blind (and deaf). She does so and he pretends to be blind. When the wife receives her lover, her husband finds an opportunity to kill him (and puts some food in his mouth to make it look as if he choked on it). Cf. Type 1380. The husband brings the body of the lover back home (to a shop, inn) and asks in a disguised voice if he may come in. The wife (the shopkeeper) thinks her husband (a drunk) is at the door, and tells him to spend the night with his mistress (to go home). The woman refuses to open the door even when the man says he will die (hang himself). The husband leans the corpse against the door (hangs it on the door). In some variants the woman (repeatedly) has the body delivered to another place where it is killed again by someone else (thief, etc.). Cf. Types 1535, 1537."
457,1537,The Corpse Killed Five Times,"A certain womans lover (often a clergyman or a monk) is killed by her angry husband, or a man (clergyman, occasionally a woman) is killed by accident (on purpose, is murdered). The wife (married couple, bystanders, murderer) secretly leaves the body by the neighbors door. The neighbor thinks it is a robber (adulterer) and kills it again. To cover up this murder, the neighbor takes the body to a monastery (and puts it in the abbots room, or on a toilet), where it is killed again because it will not speak [K2152]. This murderer puts the body into a sack and throws it into the river. Fishermen find it and hang it in a shop (put it in a boat or on a sledge, or tie it on a horse and drive it into a field or into a crockery shop), and the shopkeeper kills it again [K2151]. Cf. Type 1536C. Often the trickster (the first murderer) blackmails the subsequent murderers for not exposing their murders. Cf. Type 1536A."
458,1537*,Corpses Legs Left,"A soldier finds a corpse and cuts off its legs. He stays overnight with a rich farmer, and goes away early the next morning leaving the legs. A comrade of the soldier accuses the farmer of murder and blackmails him [K2152.2]."
459,1538,The Revenge of the Cheated Man (previously The Youth Cheated in Selling Oxen),"A youth (farmer, fool) goes to the market to sell cattle (fowl, eggs). On the way he meets a trickster (monk, robber, landlord, judge) who convinces him that his cattle are not worth very much. He sells (is compelled to sell) them for a very low price [K132]. Cf. Type 1551. The youth resolves to revenge himself on the trickster. He disguises himself as a beggar-woman (bride, carpenter, woodcutter, builder) and tricks him so that the trickster lets himself be tied to a tree [K713.1] and the youth is able to beat him. The trickster goes to get medical help. The youth disguises himself as a doctor and beats him again (in a monastery, bathhouse, robbers den) [K1825.1.3]. In the end the youth takes his cattle back and also gets some money. In some variants, instead of one trickster, the youth takes revenge on many (seven, twelve, forty)."
460,1538*,The Jester as Bride,"A witty fellow (trickster) dresses himself in his sisters clothes and works as a servant girl (employee) to a clergyman (master). The son of a rich man (mayor) choses him as his bride and prefers him to the priests daughters, because only he is able to pass a test of feminity (is the cleverest of the girls). On the wedding night a rope is tied to the brides leg. He frees himself, ties a goat (ram) to the end of the rope, and goes away. Then he returns wearing his own clothes and demands compensation for his sisters having been turned into a goat. In some variants the bridegroom discovers that his bride is a man and leaves town. The grooms parents bribe the servant girl not to tell what happened. Cf. Type 1542."
461,1539,Cleverness and Gullibility,"Three students (butchers, rascals) convince a farmer (fool, trickster) that his cow (donkey, mule, ox) is a goat (hen, donkey), so he sells the animal cheaply [K132]. (In variants from southern and eastern Europe, the farmer is persuaded to cut off the animals horns, ears, and tail in order to get a better price.) The farmer pays in advance at three inns and invites the students to eat with him. Instead of paying, he turns his hat around three times (hits it on the table, throws it on the floor, rings a bell), and the innkeeper says that the bill has been settled. The students buy the hat for a high price. When they try to use it, they discover the trick [K111.2]. (Variants from central Europe end here.) When the students come back for revenge, the farmer pretends to be dead. His wife (occasionally the students) revives him with a stick [K113.4]. (Or, the farmer ties a skin filled with blood under his wifes clothes and pretends to kill her.) He revives her with a magic wand (flute, violin, knife), which he sells to the students. The students kill their wives (mothers) but cannot revive them. They put the farmer into a sack (cask) to be drowned, but he trades places with a herdsman who comes by. By pretending to have found the herd of cattle on the bottom of the sea, the farmer induces his greedy adversaries to jump into the water. Cf. Type 1535. In variants from southern and eastern Europe, after the introduction in which the animal is mutilated, the farmer puts coins in the anus of his donkey (horse, cow) or mixes them with its dung. He sells the animal as a gold-producer [K111.1] (and says that the animal must remain in its stall for two weeks or forty days. The animal dies.). In some versions, the farmer sells his adversaries supposedly-wonderful objects, e.g. a messenger rabbit [K131.1], a pot that cooks by itself [K112.1], a pick that locates gold, a rifle that always hits its mark, or a self-propelled sled. Or the farmer promises to teach them to speak Latin and cuts their tongues off [K1068.2]. Some variants end with the farmer buried alive. When his adversaries come to rob the grave, he brands them [K911.1] or cuts off their genitals (noses)."
462,1539A*,Closing Up the Wine Cask,"A master (landlord) makes up a pretext to send a boy (a farmer) who has offended him to the wine cellar, where the servant is supposed to give him a beating. When the boy sees the servant, he pulls the bung out of the wine cask so that the servant has to use his thumb to close it up. The boy beats him up and runs away, taking bacon (sausage), bread, and a jug of wine with him. Cf. Type 921D*. In some variants, a guest tries to cheat an innkeeper (leaves without paying his bill) who has boasted to him that such a thing had never happened to her. He tells her that he can draw both red and white (any kind of) wine from the same cask. He bores two holes in one cask and tells her to stop them with her thumbs while he goes upstairs to get a glass (some glasses). He leaves and does not come back, so the innkeeper has to wait until her husband comes to rescue her."
463,1540,The Student from Paradise (Paris),"A student (beggar, traveler, clergyman) tells a (foolish) woman that he comes from Paris. She understands this to be Paradise. (Or, he sings, I come from heaven, or says he comes from the beyond or is a messenger from hell). The wife tells him that her husband (son) died shortly before. The student claims to have met him in paradise (hell) and tells her that her husband needs certain things. The wife gives the student money (clothes, food, horse, etc.) to take to her husband [J2326]. The oldest son (brother-in-law, husband) goes after the trickster to retrieve the money. The trickster steals his horse (the son runs his own horse to death) [K341.9.1]. Cf. Type 1540A*."
464,1540A*,Lady Sends Pig as Wedding Hostess,A trickster (farmer) tells a foolish woman (lady) that he has come to invite her hog to a wedding. She puts a gold necklace on the hog and lets him take it. (She also gives him a horse and coach to transport the animal.) In some variants her husband sets out after the man hoping to retrieve the hog. The trickster manages to steal his horse [K341.9.1]. Cf. Type 1540.
465,1541,For the Long Winter,"A man (farmer) has accumulated a store of provisions (saved some money, good clothing, or a sausage). His stupid wife reproaches him with this, and he says that it is for the long winter (spring, emergencies, a good day). Later, when he is away, a trickster (beggar) comes to the woman and says (in answer to her question) that he is the long winter. (He greets her with Good day, and she thinks that is his name.) The wife gives him the provisions [K362.1, J2460.1]. Cf. Types 1385*, 1463A*, and 1700."
466,1541**,The Student Betrays the Shoemakers,"A student (Gypsy) orders the same kind of new shoes (boots) from two shoemakers. He tries on those of the first shoemaker and says that the left shoe needs adjustment, and keeps the right shoe. He goes to the second shoemaker and says that the right shoe needs adjustment, and keeps the left. He leaves town with one shoe from each shoemaker, without having paid for them."
467,1541***,"Today for Money, Tomorrow for None (previously Today for Money, Tomorrow for Money)","A barber (innkeeper) hangs out a sign, Today for money, tomorrow for none, meaning that the shop is about to go out of business. Customers wait a day and think, they will not have to pay. The proprietor throws them out."
468,1542,The Clever Boy,"(Including the previous Type 1542A.) The king challenges the trickster Peik (Eulenspiegel, Ab Nuws, Aldar Iwan, Nasreddin Hodja, Toba, etc.) to play a trick on him. Peik borrows the kings horse to go home and get his fooling sticks (book of lies, tricksters secrets). Instead of coming back, he sells the horse [K341.8.1]. (Previously Type 1542A.) Cf. Type 1525B. When next he meets the king, Peik sells the king a cooking pot that is supposed to cook without fire [K112.1]. Later, Peik pretends to stab his sister, who has hidden a blood-filled bladder under her clothes. He revives her with a supposedly-magic flute, which he sells to the king [K113]. Cf. Type 1539. The king kills one of his daughters but cannot revive her with the flute [J2401]. Peik wears his sisters clothes and is engaged as a lady-in-waiting in the kings court. A prince wants to marry him, but Peik flees on the wedding night. (He is found to be responsible for the pregnancy of the princess [K1321.1]). Cf. Type 1538*. Peik is sentenced to death and is to be drowned in a sack (cask). He tricks someone else into taking his place [K842]. The king forgives Peik and makes him his son-in-law [L161]. Cf. Types 1535, 1539."
469,1542*,Sailor Substitute,"A woman loves a sailor, but she will only kiss him in the dark. His captain hears about this, disguises himself as the sailor, and sleeps with the woman. The woman marries the sailor. He is surprised that his wife has a baby six months later. Cf. Type 1362A*."
470,1542**,The Maidens Honor,"A mother tells her daughter to take care not to lose her honor (virginity). A tailor offers to sew up the daughters honor. In some variants, the tailor sleeps with the daughter (repeatedly), and then says he cannot sew her up because he does not have enough thread. She asks him, what about the spool(s) he has behind his needle (penis) [K1363]."
471,1543,Not One Penny Less,"This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A poor man (soldier, youth) prays to a saints picture for a certain amount of money, promising to give back double that amount at the end of a month. The sexton overhears and, hoping for the large repayment, gives the poor man what he asked for. The sexton claims to be the messenger of the saint, but the poor man refuses to repay the money to him [K464]. (2) A poor man (journeyman, farmhand, sexton, trickster) asks God (a saint) for a certain sum of money, no more and no less. A rich man (master, gentleman, priest, Jew) tests him by giving him (as a joke) 99 (999) instead of 100 (1000) (gold) coins. The poor man accepts them, saying, Whoever gave me these will surely give me the last one too, (he counts the value of the purse as the missing coin, adds a coin of his own). He refuses to pay back the money and makes blasphemous excuses (God is old and forgetful, or He cannot count) [J1473.1]. Often the tale continues: The lender goes to a judge in order to force the poor man to repay his money. Before the case is tried, the poor man tricks the lender out of his overcoat, shoes, and often his horse. Even the judge is tricked by the poor man, who makes the lender so suspicious that the judge thinks he must be insane. (Cf. Types 1525L, 1642A.) On his way home, the poor man meets someone who says he is the Son of God. The poor man demands that he give him the missing coin which his father had overlooked."
472,1543*,The Man without a Member,"(Including the previous Type 1543A*.) A father (farmer) has a marriageable daughter who is ignorant about (afraid of) sex. He finds a husband for her who claims to have no penis. This man sleeps with her and entertains her with his curry-comb (comb or some other word for his penis) so successfully that she becomes too demanding for him. He tells her that he does not have his curry-comb any more (he had only borrowed it and had to give it back, etc.). She gives him money (he borrows it from her) to go to the market and buy a new one [J1919.8]. After he leaves her (is sent away by her father because she became pregnant), she goes after him and asks him to leave her his curry-comb. He pretends to cut off his penis, but instead puts a stone in water and says that that is his comb. She asks a passer-by (monk, her father) to get it out of the water. When the passer-by takes off his clothes, she discovers her curry-comb hanging between his legs and grabs hold of it (tears it off)."
473,1543A,The Greedy Dreamer,"A man dreams that he has nine coins (bills). He demands ten (he wants to change the bills into gold). He wakes up and realizes that he had been dreaming. He regrets that he did not accept the nine coins (the bills) [J1473]. In Arabic variants the greedy man dreams that he is trying to sell his sheep (hogs) for eight dirhams (100 denari) each. A customer offers to pay him half of that. When he wakes up and sees no money, he closes his eyes and says, At least give me four."
474,1543C*,The Clever Doctor,"A man complains to a doctor that he has no sense of taste, can never tell the truth, and has a bad memory. The doctor treats him with three capsules filled with feces (puts dung in his mouth). The first restores his sense of taste, after the second, he is able to speak the truth, and when he takes the third, he proves that his memory is good. In some variants, a clever doctor heals a patient by diverting his attention. For example, in a Jewish variant a king has an inflamed eye because he touches it all the time. The doctor tells him that he is pregnant and will give birth in nine months. The king begins to worry about his stomach and touches it: Thus his eye is able to heal. When the birth does not take place, the doctor explains his trick and is made court physician."
475,1543D*,Stone as Witness,"A farmer makes a contract with his farmhand and calls on a stone to witness it. When the farmhand demands his wages, the farmer refuses to pay him. They go to court. The judge orders the stone be brought to the court to testify. The farmer exposes himself by explaining that it is too heavy (too far away) to be brought [J1141.1.3.1]."
476,1543E*,Tree as Witness,"Two friends with names that describe their characters (e.g. stupid, clever) become rich (find a treasure) in a foreign country. They decide to bury the money under a tree in order to share it later. The clever one steals the money, accuses the stupid one of theft and brings him to trial. He names the tree(spirit) as witness. The next day the judge intends to interview the tree. The clever one asks his father to hide in the hollow of the tree and to tell the judge that the stupid one has stolen the money. The astonished judge (the clever one) orders the tree to be burned [K1971.12]. The father screams, and his son is exposed and punished. The stupid one is given all the money [K451.3]."
477,1544,The Man who Got a Nights Lodging,"(Including the previous Type 1543B*.) A rascal (trickster) pretends to be deaf and takes a householders greeting as an invitation to sit at the table and help himself to the best food [K1981.1]. (He ignores the householders hints and eats well; previously Type 1543B*.) He trades the householders horse for his own, and when he is asked to pay for his food with a goatskin, he kills one of the householders goats [K258]. At night he sleeps with the wife and/or daughter. When the wife bakes pancakes for her hungry husband, the guest sneaks them himself. He informs the husband about his sexual relations with the wife (daughter) [K1572]. The husband becomes angry and goes to kill the guests horse, but kills his own instead [K942]. Every time, the guest gets the better of the householder."
478,1544A*,A Soldiers Riddle,"A soldier (apprentice, beggar) is given hospitality by an old woman (farmwife, priest, etc.). He induces her to leave the kitchen, puts the goose (chicken) that she is roasting into his sack, and substitutes his shoe.

480,1545,The Boy with Many Names,"A man is employed as a farmhand by a master (king, rich man, clergyman), but refuses to use his right name. Various people call him absurd names, for example, Bird, Hair, Sultry (I Myself, Cat, Cramp) [K602]. The different names cause misunderstands that work to the farmhands advantage: He sleeps with the daughter and wife of his master. When they accuse him, the master does not understand them, and the farmhand continues this behavior. The master knows that the servant has stolen money (other valuables), but because of his peculiar names he is not convicted of the theft. After the farmhand leaves, his tricks are discovered, but he is not apprehended because the people who seek him are ridiculed for calling out his names."

484,1545B,The Boy who Knew Nothing of Women,"A rich clergyman (farmer) wants a farmhand who will not seduce his daughter(s), and asks applicants about the genitals of a horse (other animal), the procedure of copulation, or the difference between men and women. The boys who know the right answers are not hired. After a time, a youth in disguise comes again pretending that he cannot answer the question(s), and the clergyman hires him. The clergyman calls the wifes and daughters vaginas prisons, and the youth pretends to be innocent and not to know what they are for. Through other tricks (e.g. using ambiguous names; cf. Type 1545), he seduces the sexually-naive wife and daughter in the presence of the clergyman [K1327]. For example, in a Russian variant, one night the farmhand tells his employer that he has caught a thief (which is his penis) who should be sent to prison. In the presence of the unsuspecting clergyman, he sends the thief into the prisons of the wife and daughter. When he realizes what has happened, the clergyman gets angry and curses the farmhand, thus losing an expensive wager (cf. Type 1000), and has to let him go free."

He tells her that, depending on which rings go in, he can beget a soldier, officer, or general (minister, dean, or bishop). The couple ask him to beget an officer and pay him for his services. While the soldier and the wife are having intercourse, the farmer gives the soldier a push from behind, so that, for the same price, the wife should get a general instead of an officer [K1398]. Cf. Type 1855A. In some variants the farmer, who is unable to impregnate his wife, initiates the bargain."
487,1548,The Soup Stone,"A soldier (traveler, monk) asks an old woman for food and lodging for the night. She agrees to the lodging but will not give him any food. The soldier offers to show her how to make soup from a stone (nail, ax, horseshoe) (sometimes without the introductory situation). She agrees. While the stone cooks, she brings him all that he asks for, one after another: flour, grease, meat (bacon), vegetables, etc. After they eat the soup, the soldier says he is too full to eat the stone (he sells the wonderful stone to the woman) [K112.2]."

520,1565,Agreement Not to Scratch,"This tale exists chiefly in four different forms: (1) A man (trickster) continually scratches his head or body (because of a disease) (he sneezes continually). He is promised a reward if he can refrain from scratching (sneezing) for a certain length of time. When he can no longer resist the itching, he tells a story (calls out) in which he can make gestures or sounds that permit him to scratch (sneeze) [K263]. Sometimes the listeners realize what he has done, but they reward him anyway because they admire his cleverness. (2) A bald (mangy) man (with head lice), a man who scratches himself, and a man with a dripping nose agree (are ordered, often by the king) not to touch themselves. All of them manage to break the prohibition by telling stories which they illustrate with their forbidden movements. For example, the bald man says that his father bought him a fur cap, and he mimics putting it on and taking it off. The scratching man says his father bought him clothes, and touches himself to show where they did not fit. The man with the dripping nose calls them both liars and points at them by rubbing his nose twice with his fingers. (3) A god offers a prize (his daughter, an ox, both) to whichever animal can clear a field of nettles without scratching himself. After other animals try and fail, a certain animal (spider, Brer Rabbit) wins the prize by disguising his scratching in his animated description of the ox. (4) Two men (a Jew and a Russian) agree not to scratch. Each tries to make the other break the agreement. For example, the Jew sprinkles pepper in the Russians shirt, and the Russian puts lice in the Jews trousers. When the Russian can resist no longer, he says that his uncle received medals from the czar, which he wore here and here and here, thus scratching those places. The Jew replies that his uncle received so many medals that he had to put them in his trousers pocket and feel around for them which he demonstrates."

768,1407B,The Great Eater,"A man who is invited to dinner eats an enormous amount of food. He apologizes for having eaten so little, saying he does not feel well today and that next time he will do better [J1468]."
769,1408,The Man who Does his Wifes Work,"(Including the previous Type 1408A.) This type is usually a framework into which other anecdotes of stupid people are set. Its basic form is as follows: Following a quarrel in which the husband complains that he works hard while his wife stays comfortably at home, a married couple agree to exchange work. Or, the husband (son) is unable to work outside. His wife (mother) must do the outdoor work for him, while he does the housework. Often, the wife gives her husband instructions about what work he should do. He does not pay attention and wastes half the day resting. The man tries to do several chores at once, and does everything wrong so that he suffers a series of accidents, e.g. he leans over the well while he is carrying the butterchurn on his back, so that the cream falls into the water (previously Type 1408A), he lets wine or beer run out of the cask and throws flour on top of it to dry the floor [J2176.1] (cf. Type 1387), he lets the cow graze on the roof [J2132.2] (cf. Type 1210), bathes the baby in boiling water [J2465.4] (cf. Type 1013), or demands that the pots walk home by themselves [J1881.1.3] (cf. Type 1291A), etc. When the wife returns home, she finds that her husband has made a mess and that everything is in chaos. The man admits that he had undervalued his wifes work, and they agree that both of them should go back to their accustomed duties [J2431]. Or, the couple do not become reconciled: the wife beats her husband and drives him away."
770,1408B,Fault-finding Husband Nonplussed,"A husband is hypercritical and nothing his wife does pleases him. In order to give him no grounds for complaint, the wife cooks several dishes for dinner. Each time he objects to what she serves him, she is able to produce a substitute dish. When he grows more and more unhappy, she asks him what he could like to eat. He says,I want to eat shit! Shortly before, their child had relieved himself on a tablecloth, so she readily gives her husband what he asked for [J1545.3]. Cf. Type 1739A*."
771,1408C,The String of Chickens (Including the previous Type 1876,") A foolish husband is supposed to take care of the animals and the house while his wife is away. A hawk steals one of the chickens, so the wife beats her husband when she returns. When she goes away again, the husband vows to do better. He ties the chickens (and the chicks) all together with a string to protect them from predators. This enables the hawk to steal the whole flock at once."
772,1409,The Obedient Husband,"(Including the previous Types 1409A1409C.) This miscellaneous type comprises various tales (three subtypes) dealing with a husband who follows his wifes instructions literally and without thinking.

(2) A wife (who insists on cleanliness) tells her husband (who has tracked dirt into the house) that he should go away for a while.

(3) A husband moves slowly at the request of his wife. Therefore he comes home only at dawn, after her lover is sure to have left [J2523.2]. (Previously Type 1409C.)"
773,1409*,The Woman Cooks the Dog for Dinner,"A wife serves her husband cooked dog instead of a pig, because she ate the pig by herself. After the unsuspecting husband has finished eating, he looks for the dog as usual to give it the bones. His wife scoffs at him (tells him a wolf ate the dog)."
774,1410,Four Mens Mistress,"A jealous husband accuses his wife of adultery and, in order to confirm his suspicions, disguises himself as a priest to hear her confession. Recognizing him, she confesses that she has slept with a servant, a knight, a fool, and a man of God. When her angry husband identifies himself to her, she explains that all of these were himself: at first he served her, then he went to war, then his jealousy turned him into a fool, and now as a priest he has heard her confession [J1545.2]."
775,1415,Lucky Hans,"Hans works for seven years and receives a lump of gold as big as a mans head as his pay and goes home. Because he finds it too heavy to carry, he trades the gold for a horse, which throws him because he does not know how to ride.

She makes sure that the two of them fall to the ground (she falls off the donkey) and her lover lands on top of her (sees under her skirt). At the trial, she swears honestly that no one except her husband and the pilgrim (driver) has ever lain on top of her (has ever seen her naked). Because what she swore under oath was true, she is not burned by the red-hot iron used for the ordeal [K1513]."
779,1418*,The Confession (previously The Father Overhears),"A young bride (wife) confesses to her bridegroom (husband) that she has had sexual relations with another man (has an illegitimate child, after her bridegroom had confessed to her that he too has an illegitimate child).

The wife tells her lover not to worry and to wait in the garden, and goes quickly to her husband. He suspects something is amiss and asks where the servant is. She suggests he should wear womens clothes and go and look for him. The husband does so and finds the servant in the garden. The servant slaps him and tells him that a woman should not cheat on her husband. The husband is reassured and rewards the servant for his good morals [K1510]. (2) When her husband comes home suddenly, a wife quickly hides her lover in a chest [K1521.2] (featherbed, cupboard, suitcase). A betraying part of his body (clothing) hangs out, and she manages to warn him indirectly to pull it in. Later he escapes. (Previously 1419K*.) Cf. Types 1419AH, and 1419J*."

Wherever a husband rules the house, the traveler gives him a horse, and wherever a wife is the master, she receives an egg. There is a great demand for eggs [T252.1]. Finally the traveler finds a man who claims to be master. When this man chooses a horse, his wife contradicts him and he has to settle for an egg. (2) A ham is offered as a price to any man who does not regret his marriage vow during the following year (and a day), or who can prove that he is not afraid of his wife. (3) A piece of bacon is hung at the city gate with a written message: It will go to whichever husband will swear that his wife does not dominate him. The farmer who claims the bacon refuses to hide it under his smock, because he is afraid of what his wife will say if he gets marks from the fat on his Sunday coat. (4) A priest asks all the men who consider themselves to be masters of their house to sing the song Christ Is Risen. All the men are silent and all the women (only one man) sing.

In some variants a hare drives an elephant (several elephants) out of the realm of the hares by showing it a reflection of the moon in water, seemingly quivering with anger [K1716]. (Previously Type 92A.) Cf. Types 34, 34A, 1168A, and 1336."
1110,93,The Master Taken Seriously,"This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A mother fox and her children hear the owner of a vineyard in which they live cursing them. They do not leave until he begins to cut the vines. (2) A bird and her young have their nest in a field of grain. When the farmer asks his neighbors to help with the harvest (the farmers sons begin to harvest the field), the birds remain in their nest. They leave only when the farmer himself begins to harvest the field [J1031]."
1111,1,The Theft of Fish,"(Including the previous Types 1* and 1**.) A fox (hare, rabbit, coyote, jackal) lies in the road pretending to be dead. A fisherman throws him on his wagon which is full of fish (cheese, butter, meat, bread, money). The fox throws the fish out of the wagon [K371.1] and jumps down after them [K341.2, K341.2.1]. A wolf (bear, fox, coyote, hyena) tries to imitate this and pretends to be dead, too. The fisherman catches him and beats him [K1026]. Cf. Types 56A, 56B, and 56A*. In some variants one animal (rabbit, fox) pretends to be dead in order to distract a man who is carrying a basket of food. Another animal (fox, wolf) steals the basket. (Previously Type 1*, cf. Type 223.) Or an animal makes a hole in the basket so that the contents fall out. (Previously Type 1**.)"
1112,10***,The Fall over the Edge (previously Over the Edge),"A fox and a bear (wolf, man, devil) sleep together on the edge of a cliff. The fox pushes his companion over the edge so that he falls down and dies [K891.5.1, K891.5.2]."
1113,15,The Theft of Food by Playing Godfather (previously The Theft of Butter [Honey] by Playing Godfather),"A fox (cat, jackal) and a wolf (bear, mouse) live together. The fox pretends that he has been invited to be godfather at a baptism (invited to a funeral or wedding) but instead he secretly eats up the butter (honey) that he and the wolf have stored. This happens again (three times). When the wolf asks him the name of the baptized child, the fox makes up names that reflect the diminution of the stored food [K372]. When the wolf discovers the butter is missing he accuses the fox, who denies having taken it. The fox proposes a test to determine who took the butter: both of them will lie in the sun and after some time the butter will melt and appear. While the wolf sleeps, the fox smears butter on him and thus proves his guilt [K401.1]."
1114,15*,The Fox Entices the Wolf away from his Booty,(Including the previous Type 15**.) This miscellaneous type consists of various tales about a fox who entices a wolf away from his booty so the fox can eat it himself [K341].
1115,2,The Tail-Fisher,"A bear (wolf) meets a fox who has caught a big load of fish. He asks him where he caught them, and the fox replies that he was fishing with his tail through a hole in the ice. He advises the bear to do likewise and the bear does. When the bear tries to pull his tail out of the ice (because men or dogs are attacking him), it is frozen in place. He runs away but leaves his tail behind [K1021]. Cf. Type 1891."
1116,20A,Animals Caught in a Pit Eat One Another Up (previously The Animals are Caught in a Pit),"(Including the previous Type 20.) A number of animals (fox, wolf, bear, hog, rooster, hen, goat, cat, hare, mouse) go on a journey (a pilgrimage) together [B296] to seek their fortunes. They try to jump over a pit but fall into it instead. Cf. Types 130, 130B, and 210. When they grow hungry, the fox proposes that they eat the one amongst them with the ugliest name (who can sing highest or loudest, who can howl the longest, who is the youngest or the smallest). Thus all the animals are eaten one after another, until only two (fox and wolf) remain or only the fox is left [K1024]. Cf. Type 231*."
1117,20C,The Animals Flee in Fear of the End of the World,"(Including the previous Type 2033.) A chicken (cat, mouse) is frightened by a nut (acorn, leaf) that falls on its head [Z43.3] (tail), or another animal is frightened by a noise (a fart) [J1812]. The chicken thinks this is a sign of an approaching war (the end of the world, the sky is falling down), and flees in panic together with the rooster (they go to tell the king about the disaster). They meet other animals (e.g. goose, hare, dog, bear, wolf, fox) who come to share their fear and go along with them. The misunderstanding is cleared up, or the animals fall into a pit (see Type 20A). In some variants they arrive at the foxs den. The fox invites them inside and eats them (see Type 20D*)."
1118,20D*,Pilgrimage of the Animals (previously Cock and Other Animals Journey to Rome to Become Pope),"(Including the previous Type 61A.) A rooster wants to go to Rome in order to become pope [B296.1]. His wife accompanies him, along with more and more other animals. They meet the fox, who invites them to rest in his den. He asks them to sing and eats them one by one afterwards (see Type 20C). Often the fox pretends to go on a pilgrimage (to a convent). Other animals (chicken, duck, goose, magpie, sparrow) go along with him. The fox asks to hear their confessions or accuses them of sins which are characteristic of the different kinds of animals. Then the fox eats them as a punishment. In some variants the fox tells the rooster (partridge, lark) that he has become religious and repents his past actions [K2027], or he dresses as a nun [K2285]. Then he reproaches the rooster with his sins (his polygamy) and offers to hear his confession. When the rooster comes near, the fox catches him and gobbles him up. Or, the rooster escapes by a ruse. (Previously Type 61A.) Cf. Types 113B, 165."
1119,21,Eating his own Entrails,"(Including the previous Type 21*.) A fox and a wolf (bear, hog, tiger) fall into a pit together and grow hungry. The fox has concealed under his body (in his fur) the entrails (brain, eye) of an animal that he had killed earlier, and begins to gnaw on them. He tells the wolf that he cut open his own belly and is eating his own entrails [K1025, K1025.1.]. When the wolf tries to copy this, he dies."
1120,23*,The Fox (Man) Induces the Wolf (Bear) to Impale Himself,"A fox challenges a wolf (bear) to jump over a stake. The fox notices that the wolf jumps sideways, so he shows him how he should jump straight forward. Thus the wolf becomes impaled on the stake. The fox tells him he should make an effort to get off, which causes the wolf to be stuck even more firmly."
1121,2A,Torn-off Tails (previously The Buried Tail),"(Including the previous Type 64.) A fox (jackal, wolf) who has been tricked into losing his tail asks his companions to tie their tails together. When they run away suddenly, they pull each others tails off. The men (animals) in pursuit cannot tell which fox they were chasing, because now there are many foxes without tails [K1021.1]. Cf. Type 78. In some variants a fox who has lost his tail in a trap tries to convince other foxes to have theirs cut off. Often, he does not succeed [J758.1, cf. J341.1]. (Previously Type 64.)"
1122,2B,Basket Tied to Wolfs Tail,"A wolf sees a fox who has many fish, and would like to catch some himself. The fox tells him to hang a basket from his tail. The wolf does this. The basket is filled with water, or the fox fills it secretly with stones, so that the wolf cannot pull his tail out [K1021.2]."
1123,2D,The New Tail (previously Wolf [Bear] Persuaded to Turn in Wind),"(Including the previous Types 2C and 40B*.) A wolf (bear) gets a tail out of flax (hemp) to replace the tail he has lost. A fox provokes him to jump over a fire. Thus the new tail is burned (the wolf himself is burned). (Previously Type 2C.) The fox tells the wolf to hold his burning tail up in the wind, but it only burns faster. The wolf is injured or killed. In some variants, the fox convinces the wolf to go to a smith to have a new tail welded on. The wolf is thus severely injured. (Previously Type 40B*.)"
1124,3,Simulated Injury (previously Sham Blood and Brains),"A fox covers his head with a milky substance (buttermilk, yoghurt, cheese, cream) or dough and convinces a wolf (bear) that he has been so badly injured that his brains are coming out [K473, K522.1, cf. K1875]. Cf. Types 8, 21."
1125,3*,The Wolf Supplies Food for the Fox (previously The Bear Throws Hens to the Fox),"A fox convinces a wolf (bear) to go into a hen house (stable) and throw the chickens (lambs) out to him. Then the fox tells the dogs and they attack the wolf. The fox runs away taking the chickens with him [K1022.3]. When he meets the wolf later, the fox pretends that he has been attacked worse than the wolf."
1126,30,The Fox Tricks the Wolf into Falling into a Pit,"A fox (hedgehog, pig, hare) entices a wolf (lion, jackal) to a pit (well, trap). He dares the wolf to jump over the edge, or tells him there is food in the well. The wolf falls (jumps) in and is trapped. Or, the fox lures the wolf into a concealed trap."
1127,31,The Fox Climbs from the Pit on the Wolfs Back,"A fox jumps (falls) into a well and cannot get out by himself. He entices another animal (wolf, goat, bear) to come down with him. When the wolf asks how they will be able to get out, the fox says they will help each other. He climbs up on the wolfs back and gets out. On top of the well he mocks the wolf and does not help him out as he had promised [K652]."
1128,32,The Wolf Descends into the Well in one Bucket and Rescues the Fox in the Other,"A fox (hare, hedgehog) falls or jumps into a well because he is thirsty (is fleeing from someone, or wants to trick the wolf into coming down) and sits in a bucket. He persuades the wolf (jackal) to get into the other bucket, and this lifts the foxs bucket up to the top so he can get out [K651]. Often men find the wolf in the well and beat him."
1129,33,The Fox Plays Dead and Is Thrown out of the Pit and Escapes,"A fox (often together with one or more other animals) is caught in a trap (pit) and cannot get out. When the hunter comes, the fox pretends to be dead [K522]. The hunter takes him out of the trap and, thinking he will not move, lays him down. The fox runs away. Cf. Types 1, 105*, 233A, and 239. Other animals try to imitate the foxs trick and pretend to be dead, but the hunter is not fooled a second time."
1130,34,The Wolf Dives into the Water for Reflected Cheese,"(Including the previous Type 34B.) A wolf (fox, hyena, monkey) sees the moon reflected in water (a well) and thinks there is a cheese (sheep, butter) lying under the water. He jumps in to get it [J1791.3]. Often another animal (the fox) persuades the wolf to do this. Cf. Types 1335A, 1336. In some variants the animal tries to drink up the water in order to get some cheese that he supposes is under it. He bursts. Or, the fox plugs him with a stopper just before he would have burst, and removes it when they come to an inn (a party). (Previously Type 34B.) Cf. Type 1141."
1131,34A,The Dog Drops his Meat for the Reflection,"A dog swims across a river (crosses a bridge) with a piece of meat (a bone) in his mouth. When he sees his reflection, he thinks it is another dog with a bigger piece of meat. In an effort to take the meat from this dog, he dives after him (jumps into the water) and loses his own meat [J1791.4]. Cf. Types 34, 92, 1336, and 1336A."
1132,34C,The Monkey with the Lentils,"A monkey drops a lentil (nut) out of his hand. As he climbs down the tree to find it, he drops the other lentils which he also had in his hand. When he reaches the ground, he cannot find any of the lost lentils [J344.1]."
1133,35A*,The Fox Asks the Wolf for Meat,"A fox smells the meat that a wolf has caught, but gets nothing. He suggests to the wolf how to protect the meat from greedy neighbors, and steals it at night [K331]. Cf. Type 1792."
1134,35B*,The Fox Gets Bait from Trap by Luring Wolf into It,"A fox finds a piece of meat by the roadside, but he is afraid that it might be a trap and does not eat it. When a wolf comes the fox tells him about the meat. The wolf goes to take it and falls into the trap. The fox is then able to eat the meat without danger [K1115.1]. In many variants the fox pretends to be fasting and thus says that he cannot eat the meat. When he eats it afterwards, he tells the wolf that the time for fasting is over."
1135,36,The Fox Rapes the She-Bear (previously The Fox in Disguise Violates the She-Bear),"A fox (hare) asks the children of the mother bear (wolf, fox, lioness) about their mother and says he would like to sleep with her. The mother bear overhears this and lies in wait for the fox so she can catch him. He slips between two trees but she is caught between them, and the fox rapes her [K1384]. The fox uses mud to color himself black and comes back to the bear disguised as a monk [K521.3]. She asks him if he has seen the fox. He asks her if it was the fox who raped her, and she worries that all the animals already know what happened to her."
1136,37,The Fox as Nursemaid for the Mother Bear,"(Including the previous Type 37*.) This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A mother bear needs a nursemaid to take care of her children while she goes out hunting. Out of all (e.g. hare, wolf, ox, fox) who apply, she chooses the fox (hyena). Each time she goes out he eats one of her children, but makes sure that she does not notice that they are missing. After the fox has eaten all of the children, he leaves [K931]. In north European variants the mother bear requires that the applicants sing well, and thus chooses the fox. In a few variants the fox and the goose raise their children together and take turns minding them. The fox eats the goslings. (2) The applicants must sing to prove that they would be good hired mourners. While the mourning husband organizes the burial, the fox eats the corpse. (3) Instead of a nursemaid, a shepherd is needed for a herd of sheep. One after another, the sheep are eaten by the fox [K934]. (Previously Type 37*.) Cf. Type 123B."
1137,38,Claw in Split Tree,"A man (fox) asks a bear (tiger) to help him fell a tree (split wood). The bear is to hold his claw on a part of the tree. The man removes a wedge he had put there, so that the two pieces of wood spring back together and the bear is caught [K1111]. In some variants the bear asks the man for help, but the man says that the bear must help him first."
1138,4,Sick Animal Carries the Healthy One (previously Carrying the Sham-Sick Trickster),"A fox tricks an injured wolf (bear) into carrying him on his back [K1241] by pretending to be injured himself [K1818]. While he is being carried, the fox says, The sick animal carries the healthy one (The one who was beaten carries the one who was not.) When the wolf asks about his chant, the fox changes the words around or threatens the wolf (by saying that dogs are chasing them). Cf. Type 72."
1139,40A*,The Wolf and the Bell (previously Wolf Has Tail Attached to Bell),"(Including the previous Types 40 and 160***.) Cf. Type 110. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A wolf and a fox eat food that does not belong to them. The fox fixes a bell to the wolf so that, if anyone opens the door, they will be warned and be able to escape quickly. The wolfs tail becomes caught in the bell cord (he is hung up on the cord). (2) A wolf forces a fox to give him food. The fox takes revenge by ringing a bell which betrays the wolf, or the wolf accidentally reveals himself by ringing a bell [K1114, K1022.4]. (Previously Type 160***.) (3) The animal that wolf and fox want to eat wears a bell, which the fox rings in order to betray the wolf. (Previously Type 40.)"
1140,41,The Wolf Overeats in the Cellar,"(Including the previous Types 33*, 33**, 41*, and 160**.) A fox (cat, jackal, hedgehog) convinces a wolf (polecat, hyena, antelope) to join him in breaking into a cellar (storehouse, stable, kitchen, vineyard) to steal food. While they eat, the fox keeps checking to be sure that he still fits through the narrow exit. The wolf eats so much that he cannot leave. He is caught and beaten (killed) [K1022.1]. In early variants, a fox in a storehouse eats so much that he cannot leave. A weasel advises him to fast. (Previously Type 41*.) Or, the fox pretends to be dead because he is so fat that he cannot leave the cellar without help. Thus he is able to escape. (Previously Type 33**.)"
1141,43,"The Bear Builds a House of Wood; the Fox, of Ice","(Including the previous Type 1097.) In the winter, a fox (wolf, bear) builds himself a fine house of ice. A hare (wolf, fox, bear, sheep, goat) builds himself a house of wood (stone, iron, grass, wool). When summer comes, the foxs house melts, and he goes to live in the hares house. He gradually pushes the hare out [J741.1]. Cf. Types 80, 81, and 1238."
1142,44,The Oath on the Iron,"(Including the previous Type 44*.) To settle a dispute (about their communal food supplies) a fox (hedgehog, sheep) proposes to a wolf that they swear on an iron trap (called Gospel) to tell the truth. This tale exists chiefly in four different forms: (1) The fox touches the trap delicately. The wolf hits it hard so its jaws snap together and catch him [K1115]. (2) A hedgehog wants to swear on a tree with a trap that is called a judge. When the judge does not answer him, a wolf pushes the trap so hard that he is caught in it. (3) A wolf wants to skin a sheep, but a fox, who is the sheeps friend, makes the wolf promise not to harm him. He swears by kissing a trap, and is caught in it. (Previously Type 44*.) (4) A sheep proposes to swear on a bush in which a dog is hiding. The dog attacks the wolf."

A fox (wolf, bear, monkey, several animals) runs into a seemingly-dead horse (donkey, dog) and (on the advice of another animal) wants to take the carcass home for food. He ties (bites) himself to the dead animals tail [K1022.2, K1047] and starts to drag it home. The horse jumps up and runs away, dragging the fox to his master, who beats (kills) the fox. Or, the fox persuades the wolf to tie a rope around the wolfs neck and the other end around the animal they want to eat. The wolf is strangled. (Previously Type 47C.) Cf. Types 1875, 1900. Often the animal only pretends to be dead, in order to catch the fox. Sometimes the hare witnesses the event and laughs so hard that his lip splits [A2211.2, A2342.1]."
1144,47B,The Horse Kicks the Wolf in the Teeth,"(Including the previous Types 47E and 122J.) A wolf (lion) wants to eat a horse (mule, donkey, foal). Before the horse will let himself be eaten, he demands that the wolf does him a favor, e.g. take a thorn out of his foot, remove his iron shoe, or read his name (his genealogy [J954.1], age, selling price) which is printed on the bottom of his hoof. Or, he asks to be eaten from his hindquarters forward. When the wolf approaches his hoof, the horse kicks him [K566, K1121]. Sometimes a fox persuades a wolf to look for a horses name (genealogy) under his hoof. Or, the wolf asks God to give him something to eat, or pretends to be a doctor and examines the horses hoof [K1955, K1121.1]. In some variants a lion sends a wolf and/or a fox (jackal) after a donkey (horse, camel), who is absent from the parliament of the animals. When they ask why he did not attend, the donkey says he has a charter under his hoof that excuses him. When the wolf attempts to read the document, the donkey kicks him [J1608, K551.18]. (Previously Type 47E.)"
1145,47D,The Dog Wants to Imitate the Wolf (previously The Dog Imitating a Wolf Wants to Slay a Horse),"(Including the previous Types 101*, 117*, and 119C*.) A wolf (bear) teaches a dog (jackal, fox) to hunt and, before he preys on a horse, he asks the dog whether his eyes are bloody and/or his hindquarters are trembling. Then he attacks the horse and kills it. When the dog hunts by himself, he asks the same question to a weak companion (cat, hare). After a horse wounds (kills) the dog, his companion says that the dog now really looks frightening because not only his eyes are bloody. Cf. Type 47B."
1146,48*,"Flatterer Rewarded, Honest One Punished (previously The Bear who Went to the Monkey for the Gold Chain)","(Including the previous Type 68**.) The fox flatters the monkey (bear, siren, animal king) and says his children are pretty. The monkey rewards him (gives him food). The wolf (bear) is also hungry, but he tells the monkey the truth about his children and the monkey beats him [J815.1]. In some variants, a self-appointed emperor of the monkeys asks two travelers who he is. One says he is the emperor and is rewarded; the other says he is a monkey and is punished. Cf. Type 51A."
1147,49,The Bear and the Honey,A fox promises to take a bear (hyena) to a beehive. Instead he takes him to a wasps nest. The bear bites into it and is badly stung [K1023]. Cf. Type 1785C.
1148,49A,The Wasp Nest as Kings Drum,"A monkey (hare, fox, deer) and a tiger (bear, lion, coyote) go hunting together. The tiger finds the monkey sitting next to a wasps nest (beehive). The monkey says he is guarding his masters drum (organ, garbage [K1056]). Or, he has a snake which he calls his flute (scepter, walking stick) [J1761.6]. The tiger asks him to play his drum, and is stung by the wasps [K1023.1, K1023.5]."
1149,5,Biting the Tree Root (previously Biting the Foot),"A wolf (bear, dog, tiger) chases a fox (heron, turtle) and is able to seize his leg (tail). To get free the fox pretends that the wolf has only a tree root in his mouth, so the wolf lets go (and seizes a tree root). The fox runs away [K543]. Cf. Type 122L*."
1150,50,The Sick Lion,"A lion (bear, tiger) is sick, and all the animals except the fox (jackal) visit him. The wolf (lynx, coyote, hyena) calls attention to the foxs absence, which angers the lion. The fox overhears this. He comes and tells the sick lion that he will recover if he applies a fresh wolfskin to his body (eats fresh wolf meat [K961.2]). The lion has the wolf skinned [K961]."
1151,50A,The Fox Sees All Tracks Going into Lions Den but none Coming out,"A lion who is too weak (lazy) to hunt any more pretends to be sick and stays in his den. One by one the animals come to visit him and he eats them. When the fox comes, he sees the tracks going in, but none coming back out. He decides not to go in [J644.1]. Cf. Type 66A."
1152,50B,The Fox Leads the Donkey to Lions Den but Is Himself Eaten,"In order to save himself from being eaten, a fox brings his friend the donkey to a lion. But the lion eats the fox anyway, before the donkey [K1632]."
1153,50C,The Donkey Boasts of Having Kicked the Sick Lion,"An old, weak lion is insulted and attacked by the animals whom he used to hunt. A bear, ox, donkey, etc. take their revenge and boast of it [W121.2.1]."
1154,51,The Lions Share,"A lion (tiger), a wolf (donkey, panther, dog), and a fox (jackal) go hunting together. The wolf has to divide the booty and gives each the same amount. The lion kills him. Then he demands the fox to divide the booty. The fox gives it all to the lion (gives the lion the meat and takes the bones for himself) [J811.1]. When the lion asks the fox where he learned to do that, the fox replies, From the wolf. In some variants the booty is never divided. Instead, the lion claims it all and no one dares to contradict him [J811.1.1]."
1155,51***,The Fox as Umpire to Divide Cheese,"Two animals fight over some prey (cheese, meat) and ask a fox (monkey, cat) to judge the case. He eats it himself (cat eats the two animals [K815.7]) [K452]. Cf. Type 926D. In some variants the fox takes bites from the pieces of food to make both parts the same. In the end he eats them both."
1156,51A,The Fox Has the Sniffles (previously Fox Refuses to be Mediator),"A lion (wolf) asks the animals if his breath smells bad (his den is dirty). Those who say yes are killed. The monkey gives a flattering answer so that the lion will not kill him. Later the lion pretends to be sick and claims that he needs monkey meat to be cured, so the monkey is killed after all. The fox says he has the sniffles (forgot his glasses) and cannot smell, so he is not killed [J811.2]. Cf. Type 243A. Often the animals are killed, whether they say the lions breath stinks or not."
1157,52,The Donkey without a Heart,"A lion (tiger, wolf) wants to eat a donkey (deer, ram, camel). A fox (jackal, hedgehog) persuades a donkey to go with him to the lion (to go into the service of the king of animals). On the first approach, the donkey runs away, but the fox persuades him again and the lion kills the donkey. The fox secretly eats the donkeys heart (ear, brains). The lion notices that the organ is missing, but the fox claims that this donkey never had a heart, because if he had one, he would not have let himself be deceived [K402.3]. In variants from central Asia, a wolf, a bear, and a fox catch a camel who lets himself be eaten. While the bear and the wolf clean (butcher, transport) the carcass, the fox eats the heart (brains, intestines). He tells the wolf that the bear ate it. While the bear and the wolf fight, the fox runs away with the meat. Cf. Types 785, 785A."
1158,53,The Fox at Court (previously Reynard the Fox at Court),"A fox is summoned before a judge because of his crimes (e.g. stealing chickens, being absent from the parliament of the animals) and is condemned to death. By means of his last request, he manages to escape [J864.2, cf. K2055]. In some variants the fox is finally killed by a man."
1159,53*,The Fox Investigates a Roar (previously The Fox and the Hare Hear Screaming),A fox (lion) hears a loud roar and is frightened but he goes to see what caused it. He finds a frog who is croaking and steps on (kills) him [U113].
1160,55,The Animals Build a Road (Dig Well),"The animals (birds) decide (are commanded by God) to build a road (well, reservoir). One animal (mole, mouse, snake, crab, swallow, raven, oriole) refuses to help because he thinks he can go where he wants without it (can always find enough water). The animals prevent him from going to the well [A2233.1], or he is killed when he crosses the road [A2233.1.2, A2233.1.3] [Q321]."

Thus the fox eats one of the chicks every day. When only one is left, the mother tells another mother bird (crow, magpie) about her misfortune. This bird replies that a fox cannot cut down a tree. The mother refuses to give the last chick to the fox, who decides to take revenge on the neighbor bird. When he sees her, he pretends to be dead. The bird approaches him, and the fox kills and eats her [K751, cf. K827.4]. Cf. Type 1."
1163,56A*,Fox Plays Dead and Catches Bird,"A fox (cat) pretends to be dead in order to catch a bird (crow) that comes near him. The fox eats it [K827.4, K911].

The child asks the servant for mercy; he is not killed [K512] but raised by a smith. In order that her husband should not discover this deceit, the queen takes the smiths son as her own [K1921.1]. During their childhood, the two boys play along with others. In their game, Solomon stands out because, playing the part of the king [J123, P35], he convicts one of the boys as a traitor. Or, the smiths son speaks of farming matters, but Solomon speaks of military affairs. His father the king (in person or through a messenger) tests the boys wisdom with impossible tasks or difficult questions [H921].

1465,920A,The Case of the Boiled Eggs (previously The Daughter of the King and the Son of the Peasant),"A princess as baby is secretly exchanged by her mother with the son of a farmwife [K1921.1], because the king has threatened to kill her if she does not give birth to a boy.

But he is asked to pay for the value of all the chickens and their offspring that would have hatched from the eggs [J1191.2]. The king does not know how to judge the case, and by chance overhears the exchanged children playing a game, the case of the boiled eggs [H1023.1.1] (cf. Type 821B). The princess plays the role of the king and points out that chickens could never hatch from boiled eggs. The king adopts the girls decision [J123].

1466,920A*,The Inquisitive King,"Solomon states that all women could be seduced (are more stupid than men), even his mother. He proves his statement by sending a servant to seduce her. In order to test her chastity Solomon disguises himself and goes in place of the servant to the meeting point [N383.3]. When his mother is about to commit incest with her own son, she realizes the deception and curses him: He cannot die until he has measured the height of the sky and the depth of the sea (before having gone around the earth and to the bottom of the sea). Thereupon Solomon vainly attempts to measure the height of the sky and the depth of the sea [L414.1]. On the back of a bird he flies to the sun, but the birds wings are burned and he falls down (eagles take him up to the sky and let him fall down, the curse becomes true.) He sits inside a box fixed to a chain, and tells a woman to lower it down to the bottom of the sea. Unfortunately a crayfish cuts the chain. In some variants his measuring is successful. On an old womans back he rides to the stars, and devils save him from the submerged box. Cf. Types 823A*, 922."
1467,920B,The Birds Chosen by the Sons of the King (previously What Kind of Bird),"A king asks his three sons what kind of bird they would prefer to be.

The third says that he would like to be a bird that flies with many others, so as to receive advice. The king chooses the third son as the next king, because as a ruler he would always seek advice [J412.1]."
1468,920B*,The Lineage of the Kings Three Sons,"A captive king interrogates the three sons of the king who has captured him as to how they will treat him (he gives them riddles).

1470,920C*,The Choice of a Wife,"A young man asks Solomon (another king) for advice about what sort of girl he should marry: one with property, one with money, or a poor one with nothing. Solomon answers, Go away; you dont know anything; do whatever you like. (Be quiet, I am in charge; get up, so I can sit down; do whatever you like.).

1473,921,The King and the Farmers Son,"A boy (farmers son, Solomon) astonishes a king passing by his hut by giving clever answers. The answers refer to questions like: what do you (does your father, mother, brother, sister) do [H583.1H583.6]. And/or they deal with a paradoxical demand to come to the king under certain conditions [H1050H1064]. The following questions and answers are most frequent: (1) What are you doing I boil those coming and going (I boil peas, beans, and/or lentils that keep rising and falling in the water [H 583.6]). (2) What is your father doing He makes a bad thing worse (he blocks a path in a field which causes another to be trodden [H583.2.1]).

1474,921A,The Sharing of Bread or Money (previously Four Coins),"A farmer (craftsman) responds to the kings question, why he is working so hard or how he would use his salary (four coins, bread), by giving enigmatic answers: The first I eat (feed myself), the second I put out at interest (give to my children so that they can care for me when I am old), with the third I pay debts (keep my parents) and the fourth I throw away (give to my wife) [H585.1]. The king asks his ministers to interpret the farmers answers for him. When they ask the farmer, he demands a reward for each response. In a medieval version, a smith named Focus, who worked on a feast day despite the emperors prohibition, is betrayed by a statue constructed by the magician Virgil. He defends himself by stating that he needs to earn eight coins daily. Two of the coins he has to repay (to his father), two he has to lend (to his son), two are lost (to be given to his wife) and two are to be spent (for himself)."

1476,921B,"Best Friend, Worst Enemy","The central motif of the tale is the following task: A man should bring his best friend and his worst enemy [H1065]. He fulfills the task by choosing his dog as friend and his wife as enemy. The tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) When the master orders his servant (Aesop) to bring food to the person who loves him most, The servant serves his dog instead of his wife. The wife feels offended and threatens to leave her husband. The servant explains that only the dog would really love his master for it would return even if it had been beaten. (2) A young man violates the order that all old people should be killed. He hides his father with the help of his wife. Because of the intrigues of some envious men, the king demands that the young man, on pain of death, bring his servant, his friend (jester) and his enemy to the king. Following his fathers advice he takes his donkey as servant, his dog as friend (his child as jester) and his wife as enemy. The offended wife reproaches her husband for classifying her in this way after she had helped him hide his father. This betrayal turns her into his enemy and so he accomplishes the task. Cf. Type 981. (3) A young man rescues the devil (stranger, saint, ghost, robber) from a wolf (other danger) whereupon the devil promises pay for the service if the young man will bring his most faithful friend to the meeting. The man comes with his wife. The devil appears in a rich disguise and persuades the wife to kill her husband when he is asleep. Later he promises her marriage and wealth. The woman agrees. When she raises the knife (ax, stone) for the murder, the devil awakens her husband. He says that he has now repaid the man by saving his life, and refuses to pay the recompense. The man should have brought his dog instead of his wife. (The man must bring his real friend the next day. His dog follows him without being called, attacks the stranger, and proves its faithfulness.) Cf. Type 824."
1477,921B*,"Thief, Beggar, Murderer","A nobleman (emperor, clergyman) observes an old farmer laboriously plowing his field. Asked if he has no sons who can help him, the old man answers that he has three university-trained sons, one is a thief (robber, liar, oppressor), another a murderer (oppressor, Gypsy), and the third a beggar (deceiver, rascal).

1481,921D*,Witty Answers,"(Including the previous Type 1702C*.) This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with a man who makes another man angry by giving absurd answers [J1252]. A master (nobleman, lawyer) asks a farmer (foreman) returning from the market, if the market was large. The farmer answers, I did not measure it! The master says, No, I wanted to know if it was crowded The farmer says, I did not count the people! Thereupon the master becomes angry and plans to invite the farmer for dinner and then to set his dogs on him. On the way to dinner the farmer finds two hares. When the master lets his dogs loose the farmer releases his hares so that the dogs chase them [K318]. The master orders his servant to serve the farmer wine in the cellar and then to beat him. When the farmer takes away the plug from the cask, the servant has to hold the hole closed and the farmer beats him. Cf. Type 1539A*. Later the farmer hides a piece of bacon under his shirt and bends over as he climbs the stairs. When people ask him if he has enough, he answers, Now I have enough for my children and for myself to lick for six weeks! When the farmer is brought to court for beating the servant, he pretends to be an idiot and therefore cannot be tried."
1482,921E,Never Heard Before,A man is required to say something that neither the king nor his courtiers has ever heard before [H1182]. The man reads a letter supposedly from another king demanding repayment of money that this king had borrowed.
1483,921E*,The Potter,"A potter amazes the king with his clever answers. The king orders his nobles to buy pots from the potter. The potter raises the price. One noble does not want to pay and agrees, instead of payment, to carry the potter into the palace on his shoulders.

1484,921F,Philosopher Spits in the Kings Beard,"A philosopher is invited to dine with the king. During the meal he is obliged to spit and does so in the kings beard. The servants become indignant and want to beat him, but the king insists on asking the philosopher [J152] why he did such a thing. The philosopher answers that everything else around him was silk or gold, so the kings beard was the most suitable place for spitting. The king accepts this explanation [J1566.1]."
1485,921F*,Plucking Geese (previously Geese from Rus),"A farmer (craftsman) impresses a ruler by his clever questions and answers, which his courtiers were not able to give. The ruler promises to send the farmer geese (other birds, animals) for him to pluck (cut, milk, skin). The geese are courtiers who, under threat of dismissal (death), have to solve riddles that the farmer poses. (The ruler says, The geese from Russia are flying here [the nobles]; pluck them!) Making use of the rulers advice, the farmer takes much money from them (for explaining the answer to the riddle)."
1486,922,The Shepherd Substituting for the Clergyman Answers the Kings Questions,"(The King and the Abbot) [H561.2]. A person of high social status (emperor, king, civil servant, teacher) demands that a clergyman (bishop, abbot, priest, petitioner) answers three difficult questions within a certain period of time on pain of death [H512, H541.1]. The clergyman cannot answer the questions and therefore sends a (disguised) representative [K1961] (servant, shepherd, miller, brother). This man answers all the questions correctly for him. When the deception comes to light, the questioner forgives the ruse and rewards the person who answered [Q113.4] (often spares the life of the superior or the brother). Many of the questions require measuring (counting) something that cannot be measured (counted). By means of wordplay (How much does the moon weigh A pound, since it has four quarters [H691.1]), by setting an impossible condition at the end of a non-provable statement (How many leaves are on the tree So and so many, and if you do not believe, count them [H705.2], or as many as there are stems [H705.1]), or of a non-provable comparison (How many stars are in heaven As many as grains of sand are on the beach, and if you are able to count them, you know how many stars are in heaven [H702]), etc. , the person answering turns the questioning ad absurdum. The questions include, How many drops of water are in the sea [H696.1]; How high is heaven [H682]; How many hairs are on my head [H703]; How many seconds are there in eternity [H701.1]; How far is one end of the world from the other [H681.1]; Where is the center of the earth [H681.3.1]; How much is the king worth [H711.1]; What is the sweetest song [H634]; Which is the best fowl; What is the swiftest, the sweetest and the most costly [H633, H638]; How much is a golden plow worth [H713.1]; What does God do [cf. H797]; How far is it from fortune to misfortune [H685]; What am I thinking [H524.1]. Cf. Types 875, 920A."
1487,922A,"Ahiqar [K2101, P111]","A childless minister adopts his nephew (Ahiqar), rears and teaches him. He presents his foster-son to the king, who likes the boys clever answers. When the minister becomes old, he recommends the king his foster-son as his successor. The young boy is appointed to the office, but slanders his foster-father. The king orders that the old minister to be killed. Instead, he is saved, and a slave is killed in his place. When a hostile king learns about the ministers death, he sets the king tasks that cannot be accomplished by anyone. He asks for a person who is able to build a castle in the air and who can answer difficult questions. The king searches desperately for his old minister. When he learns that he is still alive, he just reinstates him in his former position. Under a different name the old minister travels to the hostile king. He lets a child sitting in a basket be carried into the air by an eagle, where the boy exclaims, Give me stones and lime so that I can start building the palace! After solving all the riddles set by the king, he returns with a rich reward. He asks his foster-son to be summoned and punishes him with a cruel death."
1488,922B,The Kings Face on the Coin,"A king meets a farmer (smith) and receives enigmatic answers to his questions.

When the king reports his strange conversation with the farmer to his advisers, none of them knows an answer. They locate the questioner who, as instructed, refuses to tell them anything. But he gives in when his demand the payment with a certain number of coins with the kings picture on it is fulfilled. When the king hears the solution from his advisers, he suspects that the farmer has told the secret and reproaches (punishes) him. But the farmer is innocent because he had seen the picture of the ruler 100 times on the coins. He is rewarded by the king (appoints him adviser, marries him to his daughter) [J1161.7]."
1489,923,Love Like Salt,"A king (rich man) asks his three daughters, how much they love him. The two elder ones compare their love with precious (sweet) things (gold, precious stones, sugar, honey, precious clothes), but the youngest says that she loves him like salt [H592.1]. The father is offended by his youngest daughters answer and casts her out (orders her death), whereas he rewards the elder daughters in proportion to the value of their flatteries [M21]. The youngest daughter then works as a maidservant in a foreign country, whose king she later marries. She invites her father to the wedding meal and serves him dishes without any salt. Thus the father becomes aware of the indispensability of salt. The daughter discloses her identity. Cf. Type 510B."
1490,923A,Like Wind in the Hot Sun,A wife says that she loves her husband like wind in the hot sun. First he is offended but later in the hot sun he learns the value of the wind on a hot day. He understands the meaning of his wifes words (and returns to her) [H592.1.1].
1491,923B,The Princess Who Was Responsible for her Own Fortune,"When a king asks his (three) daughters who is responsible for their good fortune (who has the blessing of the kingdom, wealth and honour), the elder daughters answer that he is the one, but the youngest says that she herself (only God [cf. Type 841]) is responsible (she states that a woman is responsible for her husbands fortune). Her father becomes angry at her statement and forces her to marry a beggar (cripple) with whom she must live in humble circumstances (she is driven forth). Some variants begin with a description of a prince who became a cripple: A prince observes the struggle of two snakes and helps the weaker one, asking that it not harm him. Nevertheless the snake creeps through his mouth into his body, deforms him, and makes him sick. The prince is cast off by his father and becomes a beggar [L419.2]. Through his wifes wit (skill) the beggar becomes rich, becomes a king, or is cured of his disease [N145]. In other variants the husband magically returns to his former identity as prince [D1866]. The father visits the new king, recognizes his daughter and is forced to admit that she is responsible for her own fortune. Or her father has, in the meantime, lost his kingdom [L419.2], and wanders impoverished to the palace of his daughter."
1492,924,Discussion in Sign Language,"(Including the previous Types 924A and 924B.) [J1804]. Two men (king and shepherd, priest and Jew [H607.1], Roman and Greek, soldier and artist) have a conversation (dispute) in sign language. Interpreting signs falsely they misunderstand each other; e.g.: The king holds up one finger meaning, I alone am powerful. The shepherd thinks the king is asking for one sheep and holds up two fingers, meaning he will give two sheep to the king. The king interprets the two fingers as meaning, God is as powerful as you. (Previously Type 924B.)"
1493,925,"Tidings for the King (previously Tidings Brought to the King, You Said it, not I)","The king states that anyone who tells him his horse is dead must die. A servant tells the king about flies creeping into the mouth of his horse and creeping out where the tail is. When the king exclaims that his horse must be dead then, the servant tells him, You said it, not I. [J1675.2.1]. (Cf. Type 2040.)"

She asks each of them, what the most beautiful thing in the garden is (what he likes most). The youngest replies, Yourself. Thereupon the princess marries him [J1472]."
1495,926,Judgment of Solomon,"Two women both claim a child. The judge Solomon offers to cut it in half. One of the women refuses (lets go when the child is to be torn asunder, tries to stop the judge from cutting it) and is therefore determined to be the real mother [J1171.1]."
1496,926A,The Clever Judge and the Demon in the Pot,"In order to possess a beautiful woman, a demon (magician) takes on the appearance of her husband and claims her as his wife. The husband and the demon argue about which is the real husband. Numerous persons are asked for advice, but nobody can distinguish between the two men. Finally a judge (clever boy [who plays at being a king or a judge], shepherd, hare, jackal, parrot) states that whichever can creep into a pot (tube) is the real husband. The husband is not able to enter, but the demon creeps inside immediately. The pot is covered, and the demon is recognized and trapped. The real husband gets his wife back [J1141.1.7]. Cf. Types 155, 331."
1497,926A*,Purchase Not him who Surpasses you,"(Including the previous Type 654B*.) A father (widow) sends his son (three sons) away to learn a craft (earn money). But the boy learns to play an instrument and cards instead. When he is to be sold as slave to a merchant (when he seeks employment with a rich man) he says, Do not buy someone who is superior to you, or Whoever takes me will regret it; whoever does not take me will regret it twice as much. By his clever actions, by playing off persons against each other, by his music, and by gambling he succeeds in different situations. At the end he marries the daughter of the rich man (dealer, captain). When his father-in-law violates a kings decree (ships are no longer allowed to shoot cannons) and is condemned to death, the youth frees him from the gallows (with three empty nutshells, which signify his father-in-laws worth). At the end, the young man attains wealth and honour."
1498,926C,Cases Solved in a Manner Worthy of Solomon,"This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with the idea of unusual, often clever, methods to determine the truth [J1141ff.]. Cf. Types 1534, 1833J, and 1833K. Examples: (1) A poor man finds a purse with money in it and returns it to its owner hoping for a reward. The owner pretends that some money is missing, and that the finder took it already for his reward. The judge decides that, since the amount of money is different, the purse did not belong to the man who claimed it, and that the poor man may keep it until its rightful owner is found [J1172.1]. (2) A judge gives sticks to all the suspects in a court case and tells them that the guilty ones stick will grow during the night. The guilty man cuts a bit off his stick and thus is discovered. (3) Someone announces to all the people in the village that the thief has a gnat on his cap (that his cap is burning). One man reaches for his cap and thus shows himself to be the thief [J1141.1]. (4) All the suspects are required to touch some object in the dark, and are told that the hand of the guilty one will be blackened. In fact, the object blackens any hand that touches it. The guilty man does not touch the object and is thus the only one whose hand is not blackened [J1141.1.4]. (5) In order to determine which of two women is the owner of a spindle of thread, the judge asks them what the spindle is made of. Only the owner knows the right answer [J1179.6]. (6) Disputants are ordered to fabricate a copy of the disputed object (precious stone) [J1154.2]. The owner and the cheater can do so, but the false claimants cannot. (7) A man (innkeeper) whose silver has been stolen summons his guests (employees) to the table and orders them to make various ridiculous gestures. When they are all engaged in this game, he commands them to put their heads under the table. Then he asks if the thief has head under the table. The thief answers, Yes."

1500,926D,The Judge Appropriates the Object of Dispute,"(Including the previous Type 518*.) This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with a dispute between two parties that is decided in favour to a third person who is to judge their case. The judge either takes the contested object as evidence or destroys it [J1171, K451, K451.1, K452]. Cf. Type 926C. For example, two cats fight over a rice cake, and the monkey who is to decide the case eats it. A lawyer who is to decide the case of two men charges them such high fees that he is able to buy the disputed object (calf) with his earnings. The song of a bird was not meant for the plaintif but for the judge. Cf. Types 51***, 400, and 518."
1501,926E,Eginhard and Emma,"After spending the night with the emperors daughter in her chamber, her lover cannot leave without being discovered because snow has fallen.

His mother-in-law sets fire to the house and says that the child was killed in the fire. The husband returns the child and forgives his wife. (9) Nobody wants to buy his horse because the price is too too high. It falls sick (is injured) and dies (he keeps the skin as evidence). (10) His mare, which his friend had borrowed, dies from overwork. When his friend apologizes for his mistake he forgives him. Finally he realizes that his fathers precepts were indeed wise. (1) Just before he is arrested, he shows the judge where to find the victim. (2) To his astonishment, it is an animal. (3) It turns out that the missing person (animal) is still alive. (4) He explains that he had only intended to test the precepts of his father. (5) He is immediately freed and prosecutes the persons who tried to harm him.

1547,910B,The Observance of the Masters Precepts (previously The Servants Good Counsels),"(Including the previous Type 910H.) A poor man who cannot provide for his family takes service with a rich farmer for one year for a certain amount of money. After he has completed his service, the farmer gives him his choice of the agreed wages or a good precept. The man chooses the precept: Always follow the main road [J21.5]. Disappointed by this he hires on for a second and then a third year after which he is given various precepts: Mind your own business [J21.6] or Do not sleep where a young woman is married to an old man [J21.3] and Always postpone your anger until the next day [J21.2]. (For other examples see the numerous subdivisions in the motif-index [J21ff.].) Feeling discouraged the poor man gets ready to go home. His master gives him a loaf of bread (with money hidden inside [J1655.2]) which he should not cut until he reaches home [C320]. At a fork in the road the poor man follows the farmers advice and takes the old main road instead of a shorter new one [J21.5]. He later learns that he would have been waylaid by robbers on the new road [N765, J865]. At dusk he reaches a house where he spends the night. There he sees strange events, but he does not interfere [J21.6]. When he is about to leave, his host calls him back and rewards him with a large sum of money for his discretion (indiscretion would have brought death to the hosts wife [D700, D758]). After he has refused to sleep in a house where a young woman is married to an old man [J21.3], he witnesses a murder [K2213.3]. When an innocent man, who spent the night at the womans house, is condemned for the murder, he testifies to the mans innocence [K2155]. When the poor man finally reaches home and looks through a window, he sees a stranger kissing his wife. He intends to kill the man, but fortunately postpones his anger at the last moment [J21.2, J571]. The stranger was his own grown son. When the family gathers around the table to celebrate their reunion, the poor man cuts the bread and finds all the money he had earned hidden inside [Q20.2]."
1548,910C,Think Carefully Before You Begin a Task,"In the market (public place) a young man (king, prince) meets an old (wise) man in a shop where wisdom is told instead of goods. The old man explains to the wondering young man that the wisdom he sells would be very useful for ruling people. The young man decides to buy a precept for five coins. The old man gives him the following maxim: Whatever you do, do wisely and think of the consequences [J21.1] and he adds that if the young man will follow the precept he will become the most powerful person in the whole kingdom. Upon his fathers death the young man becomes king and orders that the maxim be displayed on all the walls of the palace. When enemies bribe his barber to cut the kings throat while shaving him, he reads the maxim at the last moment. Afraid of the possible consequences, he confesses his intention (and desists from his plan). The value of the precept is recognized."
1549,910C*,The Officer and the Barbers Apprentice,"An officer goes to a barber for a shave. He promises to pay well unless the barber cuts him, in which case the officer will kill him. The barber refuses to shave the officer, and so do the two other barbers in the shop. Only the apprentice will agree to this bargain. All goes well. As the officer leaves, he asks, Werent you afraid The apprentice answers, No. If I had cut you, I would have cut your throat right away with the razor. Cf. Type 910C."
1550,910D,The Treasure Behind the Nail (previously The Treasure of the Hanging Man),"When he dies, a rich merchant advises his spendthrift son that if ever he spends his entire fortune, he should hang himself from a special nail (beam, hook) [J21.15]. After his father dies, the son wastes his inheritance with his friends until he has nothing left. When he tries to hang himself in despair, the nail tears out of the wall and a treasure, which his father had hidden there, falls down [N545.1]. From then on the young man leads a virtuous life (pays his debts). Cf. Type 740**."
1551,910E,Find the Treasure in our Vineyard! (previously Fathers Counsel: Where Treasure Is),"A poor dying farmer tells his sons that he has hidden a treasure in his vineyard (field, ground). After his death his children dig everywhere and thus loosen the soil of the vineyard. They do not find any treasure but the vineyard becomes very fruitful. (Then they understand their fathers advice.) [H588.7]."
1552,910F,The Quarreling Sons and the Bundle of Twigs,"A man (king, farmer) explains to his (quarreling) sons, that a bundle of twigs (sticks, arrows, lances) cannot be broken, whereas separately the pieces are easily broken. Thus he demonstrates the value and the strength of unity. His sons apply the lesson [J1021]."
1553,910G,Man Buys a Pennyworth of Wit,"A rich man has a mistress although he loves his wife. His wife, hoping to change his behavior, asks him to bring her wit instead of a present (gives him a penny to buy the wit). In the market he buys wit in a bundle which also includes some rags. The seller advises him to wear the rags and to present himself as a beggar first to his mistress and then to his wife. His mistress rejects her apparently penniless lover whereas his wife is ready to help him pay his debts. He is convinced of his wifes love, confesses the truth to her, and decides to be faithful to her. The wife is happy that her husband finally has come to his senses [J163.1]."
1554,910K,Walk to the Ironworks (previously The Precepts and the Uriah Letter),"A dying nobleman who had served a long time at the kings court asks the king to employ his son. The king agrees and the dying man gives three precepts to his son. First: Never associate with enviers or slanderers (Do not talk about what you have seen or Do not dishonour your masters house with adultery). Second: Always sympathize with your masters fortune and emotions. Third: Never pass a church without going inside (Never neglect to go to mass). When his father has died the young man begins his service at the kings court. An envious man slanders him and accuses him of desiring the queen. When he, following his fathers advice, starts to weep when the queen weeps, his behavior is interpreted as proof of a love affair and it is decided that he must be killed. His adversary (slanderer) intends to throw him into the blast furnace of the ironworks (limekiln, mine, well, brewery, baking oven) or to kill him by some other means. He is sent to the place where he is to be killed. Those who are charged with his murder are told to kill the first man who arrives (he brings along a message, a letter commanding his murder [K978] or certain object such as a handkerchief or lemon). According to his fathers advice, the young man goes to mass on the way and is delayed. His slanderer (adversary), impatient to see him dead, arrives the place before him and is killed instead of him. The innocent young man then reports his slanderers death. He is restored to favor, or gains fortune, wealth and honour [K1612]. Cf. Type 930."
1555,910L,Do Not Drive the Insects Away,"This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A fox crossing a river falls into a crevice and cannot get out. He becomes infested with lice (flies). A hedgehog passing by sees the fox suffering and offers to help. The fox refuses, saying that these lice are already full, and if the hedgehog takes them away, new lice who are even hungrier will come [J215.1]. (2) A sick (injured) man covered with sores is bothered by flies. He refuses any help, saying that hungry flies bite twice as hard as full ones. (3) A merchant is captured by robbers (farmers want to punish a corrupt mayor or a thievish miller, a landlord wants to punish one of his tenants). They undress him (and cover him with honey) and tie him to a tree where there are many flies. A man (knight) offers to drive the insects away, but the merchant refuses, saying that others even worse and more hungry will come in their place. (The farmers set the mayor [miller] free and decide to let him stay in his office, lest someone even greedier would take his place.)"
1556,910M,Prayers for the Tyrant,"An old woman prays every day for the health of a hated tyrant. Asked why she does this, she explains that she has twice seen a horrible tyrant die, only to be replaced with one even worse. Therefore she hopes that the present one will live for a long time [J215.2.1]."
1557,910N,The Magic Box,"A poor farmer (farmwife) complains to his neighbor (clergyman) that his farm is not doing well. The neighbor gives him a box which he says is magic, and tells the farmer to carry it once each day through his house and barn. When the farmer does this, he notices what the problems are and becomes wealthy. In another version, an older woman tells an incompetent housewife that she should look all over her house and yard for a white sparrow. As she does this, the housewife puts everything in order and becomes prosperous."
1558,912,The Wise Man and the Rain of Fools,"During a certain rainy period, everyone on whom the water falls becomes a fool (is compelled to sing and dance). A wise man arrives and sees that all the adults and children have gone crazy. He joins them in their foolery. He asks why they behave thus, and they reply him that it is because of the rain. The wise man tastes some of the rainwater and he also becomes a fool [J1714.2, D1353.1]. In Arabic variants a ruler hears that everyone who came into contact with the rainwater became crazy, so he does not drink it. But when he sees that he no longer holds his former power and authority, he drinks the water."
1559,915,All Depends on How You Take It,"A widower with a clever, industrious daughter marries a widow with a stupid, lazy daughter. When the children are grown and ready to leave home, their mother (father) gives them three indirectly expressed precepts to guide them in their new independence (employment, marriage). On a visit the mother (parents) realizes that her own daughter has followed the precepts literally and therefore caused herself much trouble. Her stepdaughter, however, recognized the underlying meaning of the precepts (often with the help of her father) and therefore everything goes well for her [J555.1]. Cf. Type 915A."
1560,915A,The Misunderstood Precepts,"A dying father (mother) gives indirectly expressed advice to his son (daughter) (before marriage): Always eat bread with honey (means: Work diligently and your bread will be as sweet as honey) [H588.11], God bless you in your labors (means: Start your work earlier than others, so that others will greet you thus and not you them) [H588.12] and Always wear your shoes (means: Walk the fields barefooted, wear your shoes only when near the town) [H588.13]. When the son follows these precepts literally, he becomes poor. Only later does he learn their real meaning. Or, the father gives ironic precepts: Whenever you feel like gambling, do it until your eyes are red and your cheeks are pale, Whenever you feel like drinking, do it until you are drunk and fall asleep, and Whenever you desire a woman, go there early in the morning and wake her up. Following the precepts he gambles away all his money. Drinking to forget his losses, he feels so ill the next morning that he wants never to drink again. He visits a woman early in the morning and is so scared by her appearence that he runs home. There he thinks about his fathers bad precepts that cured him of gambling, drinking and womanizing. (Other precepts see H588ff.)"
1561,916,The Brothers Guarding the Kings Bedchamber and the Snake,"Several brothers are hired by a king to guard his bedchamber. The first brother sees a snake in the bedchamber and kills it, but a drop of its poison falls on the queen. While he is wiping the poison, she awakes and accuses him trying to attack her [N342.1] (cf. Type 516). The other brothers tell stories against making a hasty decision. The next morning the truth comes to light. The stories: (1) The innocent dog (cf. Type 178A). (2) The faithful dog as security for a debt (cf. Type 178B). (3) The falcon and the poisoned water (cf. Type 178C). (4) The parrot and the fruit of youth. A parrot brings to a king, his master, some fruit of youth. Unbeknown to the parrot a snake has dropped poison on the fruit. The king gives one of the fruits to a dog which dies, and then slays the parrot [B331.3]. Later the truth comes to light."
1562,800,The Tailor in Heaven,"In Gods absence, St. Peter lets an unworthy tailor into heaven [A661.0.1.2, P441.1]. The tailor throws Gods footstool at an old woman thief on earth [F1037.1]. He is expelled from heaven [L435.3]. Cf. Types 752B, 801, 805, and 1656."
1563,801,Master Pfriem,"A self-righteous shoemaker (driver, rich man) who is never satisfied, criticizes his journeymen, his servants, and his wife. He dreams he is dead. Before he is admitted to heaven, St. Peter warns him [A661.0.1.2] against fault-finding [F13]. Despite his good intentions he continues to complain. He criticizes angels who carry a beam crosswise [F171.6.3], and other angels who carry water in a sieve [H1023.2] (cf. Typ 1180) or pull a wagon with two horses harnessed in front and behind [F171.6.4]. Finally the faultfinder is expelled from heaven [Q312.1].

1564,802,The Farmer in Heaven,"A poor farmer (beggar, old woman, poor girl, preacher) arrives in heaven at the same time as a rich man (priest, lawyer, townsman, nun, hermit, saint, old couple). The rich man enters first and the poor man outside overhears that he is received with rejoicing. When the farmer enters nothing similar happens. When the farmer complains that things in heaven are handled as partially as on earth, St. Peter explains that poor people come to heaven every day, but a rich man comes only once in a hundred years [E758, W245]."

1568,804,St,"Peters Mother Falls from Heaven. St. Peter (other saint) in heaven [A661.0.1.2] is allowed to free his mother (sinner, witch, his father, woodcutter; clergyman, thief) from hell (purgatory). When she is pulled to heaven on a rope (stalk) [F51.1.3] the other inhabitants of the hell (the dead) catch her feet in order to be freed as well.

The devil cannot let this happen, so the person is expelled from hell (receives gold as rent, can marry the daughter of a king or a landlord) [K1781]."
1571,804B*,The Tavern at Heavens Gate,"In order to pay his drinking debts a man (Nobis) promises himself to the devil. But he payed the devil by taking a beating instead of his soul, so he is not allowed to enter either hell nor heaven. Thereupon he starts to run a tavern (named Nobiskrug) between heaven and hell (outside heavens gate, outside hells gate). In some variants so many people remain at the tavern in front of the entrance to heaven that finally the host is allowed to enter heaven as a preventive measure. Or, many candidates for heaven bring their own drinks from earth (they are already drunk), so that the host has to close his business."
1572,804C,Unsuitable for Hell,"A clergyman assures an old woman that she is not destined for hell because it was made for weeping and gnashing of teeth. She, however, does not have any teeth left any more."
1573,805,Joseph and Mary Threaten to Leave Heaven,"St. Peter (God, Christ), the porter of heaven, notices unfamiliar faces among his people. He learns that Joseph had opened the back door for them.

1654,983,The Dishes of the Same Flavor,"A virtuous woman (virgin, wife, widow) tries to escape from the attentions of a mighty man (king, ruler). She serves him dishes that look different but taste identical (different colored eggs, same drinks in different glasses). In response to his question what this means, she compares the dishes with women: Even if they look different, they are all alike. This is why it is not worthwhile to change sexual partners. The man is dissuaded from his amorous purpose and contents himself with his own wife [J81]."
1655,984,Palace from Bird Bones,"In accordance with his wifes wish, a king gives orders to build a palace made of bird bones. One bird comes late, and when it arrives, it says it was thinking about whether men or women were worth more. It decided that women must be worth more because those who obey women are subordinate to them. The king rescinds his order."
1656,985,Brother Chosen Rather than Husband or Son,"Three men are condemned to death. A woman appeals to the ruler for clemency, explaining that they are her brother, her husband and her son. When the ruler agrees to release only one of them, she choses her brother, because she is still young enough to marry again and give birth to another son. Only a brother cannot be replaced. Impressed by her explanation (ruse, logic), the ruler frees all three men (brother and son, the brother alone) [P253.3]."
1657,985*,The Suckled Prisoner,"(Caritas Romana). A man (woman) condemned to starvation is closely guarded. Only his daughter has permission to visit him daily, but before her visit she is always checked thoroughly so that she cannot bring any food. After a long time the condemned man shows no signs of exhaustion. One day the guardians observe that the daughter suckles her father through a crack in the prison wall (woman suckles son, wife suckles strange man, daughter suckles mother) [H807, R81]. Impressed by the womans devotion, the judges release the prisoner. Cf. Type 927."
1658,985**,Measure for Measure,"An official who desires a certain woman agrees to set her husband (brother) free from prison if she will sleep with him.

She becomes rich and builds a palace. He returns the kidnapped girl to her father and returns home to his wife. Cf. Types 677, 737B*."
1660,987,False Magician Exposed by Clever Girl,"This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A magician deceives the eyes of spectators making them believe that a rooster can pull (carry) a heavy beam (a rope-dancer can push a cart, juggle a beam). A girl with a four-leafed shamrock (snake, dead toad, salamander) understands the trick and states that the rooster can only pull straw [K1963.1]. The magician takes revenge by making the girl believe she is going through deep water. She raises her dress as high as possible and all spectators mock her. (A lock magically closes the girls mouth so that she cannot speak). (2) A juggler pretends to be able to creep through a thick beam (stone). The girl with the shamrock discovers that he only creeps over it or next to it. The water-episode follows, and in some variants the girl is bewitched into being lame or crooked."
1661,990,The Seemingly Dead Revives,"A woman becomes ill during an epidemic and falls into a deathlike faint. Her husband orders her buried and puts a precious ring (clothes) into her coffin. One of the grave-diggers returns to the cemetery at night, reopens the grave, and tries to rob the dead. Thereupon (when he tries to cut her finger) the woman revives, leaves the grave, and returns home to her husband. He receives her kindly and they continue to live together for a long time in good health [K426]."
1662,992,The Eaten Heart,"A knight woos a married woman. The husband kills his wifes lover (suitor) and orders the cook to prepare his heart and to serve it to his wife. When she praises the meal, he tells her what she has eaten, remarking that her lover pleases her dead as well as alive. Thereupon she jumps out the window (refuses any food, dies from pain). The husband regrets his deed (is punished by the ruler, by the womans relatives) [Q478.1]."
1663,992A,The Adulteresss Penance,"A merchant admires a sovereign who invites him to his castle. At dinner the merchant observes that the sovereigns wife is served her meal in a skull (her lovers head with beard). In his bedroom he finds two dead young men hanging.

By this miracle the preacher recognizes the mans holiness and understands that pious innocence is pleasing to God."
1665,830A,The Boastful Deerslayer,"A lazy man grumbles against God because he feels neglected. An old man advises him to set a trap, and God will certainly help him. The lazy man follows his advice and catches a deer. While he is skinning the animal the old man reappears and points out that God had helped him. But the lazy man emphasizes his own ability. The old man revives the deer and it runs away [Q221.6, Q223.2, E161]. The lazy man understands too late that God helped him to catch the deer. In some variants the white spots on the deers belly [A2412.1.1] (the bones on the leg resembling a knife, the grey hair on the leg) are explained as a result of the skinning process."
1666,830B,My Crops will Thrive Here without Gods Blessing,"(Including the previous Types 752C* and 830C*.) Cf. Type 836. This tale exists chiefly in four different forms: (1) A farmer sows crops. Unrecognized saints (God) wish him Gods blessing and a good harvest, but the farmer replies his crops will thrive without Gods blessing [C454]. When weeds grow in his field, the farmer is converted. (2) A poor and a rich man (farmer, sower, two brothers) sow crops. Saints (passers-by) greet the poor farmer, May God help you! The farmer thanks them for the greetings and is rewarded with a good harvest. The saints greet the rich in the same way, but he rejects their greetings by saying that his crops will also grow without Gods blessing [C454]. His harvest is very poor and he repents his behavior too late. (3) The discourteous sower. A passer-by (God) asks a farmer what he is sowing. Rudely he answers that he is sowing stones. The passer-by wishes him a good harvest, which turns out to be stone plants. (A farmer tells Christ that he is sowing pumpkins [turnips], though his seed is maize. Thereupon he harvests only pumpkins.) [Cf. A2231.1]. (4) Weather forecast. Christ asks farmers if there will be rain. Two answer that frogs (foxes, other animals) predict rain.

1667,830C,If God Wills,"This miscellaneous type comprises various tales, all of which connect the phrase If God wills with an event in an instructive or funny way.

The clergyman disguises himself in an animal skin and pretends to be the devil. He frightens the poor man and takes the treasure. But at home he cannot take the skin off [Q551.2] (until the stolen treasure has been returned). (2) The rich man (miller, butcher, baker) fails to take the treasure because the devil himself in disguise as a traveler (black horseman, soldier, hunter) stays at the poor mans house as an overnight guest (meets him on his way) and kills (abducts) the rich man. (Previously Type 750G*.)"

The second person tries to dig up the treasure at the indicated spot (tries to dig up a treasure at the same spot), or a third person (thieves, neighbor) overhears the conversation and digs there. But instead of the treasure the person unearths only a dead dog (dead cat, some toads, beetles, pot of ants, pot of serpents [N182], pot of glowing embers, pot of dung, skeleton). Angered by this deception he/she throws the animal (pot) into the house (bed, through the window, through the roof) of the dreamer, and everything is transformed into gold (silver, money) [D1454]. Cf. Types 947A, 1645."
1671,836,Pride is Punished,"A rich man (woman) boasts (often during mass) in his thoughts (in a conversation) that his wealth is so immense that even God could never take it away [C454]. When he returns home his property is completely destroyed (house has burned down) and he stays poor for the rest of his life [L412]. Cf. Types 736A, 830B."

1673,837,The Beggars Bread (previously How the Wicked Lord was Punished),"A beggar (female beggar) periodically receives a loaf from a rich man (his wife). (A rich miser refuses to give food to a beggar.) Whenever the beggar receives the bread he states, Everything you do, you do it to yourself! The rich man becomes tired of this (angry about the beggars words, wants to get rid of the beggar) so he (and his wife) puts poison into the beggars bread. Further on his way the beggar meets a hungry young man (traveler) to whom he gives his bread. The young man dies and it turns out that he is the son of the rich man. So the beggars statement was true [N332.1]."
1674,838,Son on the Gallows (previously The Bad Rearing),"From his childhood a mother (in older variants: father) teaches her son to steal (she does not prevent him from stealing).

1676,839A*,The Hermit and the Devils,"In order to tempt a hermit (bishop, monks), the devil (devils) disguised as a clergyman tries to rejuvenate him or to get him married. Or, a man (pupil of the bishop) is suspected of being a devil because he does not cross himself and leaves the church when incense is burned and benedictions are said. The brother of the hermit (old man, poor man, monks) overhears the devils discuss their plan sitting under a tree (near a well, at a rock), and warns the hermit. The hermit orders all doors, windows, holes, etc. of the church to be closed. When he burns incense and asks for heavens blessings, the devil bursts and mice (spiders) jump out of his mouth.

Cf. Type 759."
1678,840B*,The Judgments in this World,"A virtuous man, a robber, and a thief (clergyman, farmer and host [teacher]) ask a hermit (old man, God) about their fate (which of them is most certain to go to heaven). He tells them to take three different roads, where they spend the night in various situations. When they come back and tell about their experiences (the first sleeps in a fine house, the second in a forest during a storm and the third in water), the hermit explains that the experiences they had foretell their conditions of life in future."
1679,841,"One Beggar Trusts in God, the Other the King","Two beggars (blind men, shoemakers, craftsmen), one of whom asks God for help (cf. Type 923B), the other of whom asks the king (emperor, sultan, master), receive two loaves (flat cake, cakes, roasted chicken) from the king. In one of the loaves nothing (bones) is hidden, the other one is filled with (pieces of) gold. By this gift the king intended to reward the beggar who had asked for his help, and to demonstrate his secular power. But the beggars exchange their loaves, because the one who trusted in secular power thought that his loaf was not well baked because it was so heavy. When the king learns about the exchange he agrees that Gods power is stronger than his own [N351]. Cf. Types 745A, 842, and 947."

1710,883A,The Innocent Slandered Maiden,"(Including the previous Type 883C*.) In the absence of her father (parents), a relative (friend, clergyman, guardian) attempts to seduce a young woman. When she rejects him [T320.1], he writes a slanderous letter (out of revenge) to her father accusing her of loose conduct [K2110.1, K2112]. The father commands his son to kill his sister [S322.1.3]. Out of pity (believing in her innocence) the brother spares her and gives the liver (heart, blood) of an animal [K512.2] to the king as proof of the murder. The girl is abandoned. A king (prince) finds her and marries her [L162]. When the king has to go to war (when the woman with her children wants to pay a visit to her father), he tells a servant (officer, soldier, dignitary) or a relative (brother, uncle) to take care of (accompany) his wife. A second attempt at seduction is made [K2250.1], and the womans children are often killed. She escapes [T320] in mans clothes (disguised as soldier, officer or shepherd) [K1837] and works unrecognized as a servant in her fathers house (in an inn, as a shepherd). Despite the slanderers statement that the queen is dead (abducted, escaped, has murdered her children), the king searches for his wife (father searches for his daughter). Finally all persons concerned meet together and the woman in mans clothes tells them what had happened (in the form of a tale). The family is reunited and the evildoers are punished. Cf. Type 712."
1711,883B,The Punished Seducer,"Before going on a journey, a man (merchant) locks up his three daughters, and gives each of them a magic object (ring [D1610.8], flowers [D1610.3]) that will indicate if they are unchaste. A prince (knight, three princes, three young men) enters the girls room secretly (disguised as a merchant) and seduces the two elder ones. The clever youngest sister resists his attempt at seduction [L63] and teases the prince. When her sisters have given birth, she disguises herself as a beggar and carries the newborn children to the princes castle (to their fathers). When the merchant comes home and realizes what has happened, he intends to kill the two sisters. (But when the princes agree to marry his daughters he abandons his plan). The prince who wants to marry his youngest daughter plans to kill her on her wedding night. She puts a sugar doll in her place [K525.1]. He cuts the doll with his sword, and when he tastes the blood he realizes the sweetness of his wife and regrets his deed. (The girl shows up and they are reconciled with one another.) Cf. Types 879, 884."

His neighbor (foreign king, visitor, friend, governor) makes a wager on the faithfulness of the servant [N25]. In order to test the servant he is sent with a letter to the neighbors wife (queen, daughter) where the woman makes him drunk and seduces him. In some variants the maidservant (daughter, wife) is sent to the sherpherd and persuades him to give her in return for her favors a lamb or the golden horns (liver, skin, meat) of his masters best ox (sheep, horse). Or he is made to believe that he lost his masters property by gambling while drunk. Later the servant rehearses how he could justify his behavior to his master: He puts his stick into the earth with his hat on top and speaks to it.

1723,890,A Pound of Flesh,"A contract entitles the lender (Jew, merchant, usurer, nobleman) of a sum of money (that has been used to woo or to buy a woman [T52.3]) to cut a pound of flesh (eye, head, single limbs) from the debtors (Christian or Muslim merchant, goldsmith, Jew, nobleman) body if the loan is not repaid in time [J1161.2]. In some variants the husband goes abroad for some time, and other men try to seduce his wife. She deceives them all and takes their money in payment for keeping the matter secret [K443.2] (cf. Types 882A*, 1730). When the time limit has been reached, the case is brought to the judge (pope, king, sultan, the debtors wife disguised as judge [K1825.2], another woman in mans clothes [K1837]). In some variants, before the judgment has been executed, the creditor is offered the money if he will forgo the pound of flesh, but he does not agree. The judgment formally favours the creditor but adds some impossible conditions: when cutting the flesh of the debtor he must take the exact amount (he must not shed blood), otherwise he will be punished severely. Thereupon the creditor renounces his demand to mutilate the debtor (and is punished in addition)."

Disguised as the captain [K1837] she shows her ship to the prince. Then she takes a house in front of the kings palace and puts away her mans clothes. The prince falls in love with the unknown woman but she rejects his presents. Finally she accepts his third present, the Koran, but asks for a bridge of gold in addition.

The teacher leaves blood (other signs) that point at the mother as murderer of her children [K2155.1], she is imprisoned. When the prince goes on a journey, his imprisoned wife asks him to bring her a stone of patience (and a knife), which he does. The prince overhears his wife telling her sorrows to the stone [H13.2.2]. The stone swells and finally bursts because it cannot bear the sorrow (and she tries to kill herself with the knife). The prince embraces his innocent slandered wife, and the cannibal teacher brings back her children. (2) The princess finds a sleeping prince who can only be awakened if she would care for him for a certain period (seven years, seven months, seven days [Z72.2]).

On the way to the prince the (mistress of the) sea exchanges the doll with her own daughter, whom the prince marries. The prince does not recognize her extraordinary origin, so she stays mute and rejects him. The prince marries three women of royal blood, but they all die when they try to imitate the abilities of the first woman (e.g. objects obey her commands, her cut nose grows again, when she puts her finger in hot oil cooked fish appear, etc.). When the prince feigns an illness the girl cares for him, reveals her origin, and consents to the marriage.

The thiefs mother is not able to bear her grief and asks her remaining son to bring the corpse home. He manages to steal the corpse by disguising himself and by getting the kings guards drunk [K332]. To identify the thief, the king allows all men to sleep with his daughter but orders her to ask each one about his most impious deed. If one tells her about the theft of the treasure, she is to seize him and hold him fast [K425]. When the thief visits the princess she marks his forehead [H58], whereupon he marks all the other suitors in the same way [K415] (he brings along his dead brothers arm, which is what the princess seizes).

(2) A man (king, bishop, clergyman) is warned that he will die if he does not perform robberies. He does so, and meets a robber (often a man of honour, cf [3] below) from whom he learns that he himself would be murdered.

His accomplices are punished and the robber is rewarded. (Previously Type 951B.) (3) A robber (soldier) can open any door with a certain magic object, but he only steals the profit that merchants have earned unjustly [K1812.2.1].

The next day the king discloses his identity and rewards the robber for his honesty. (Previously Type 951A.)"
1740,952,The King and the Soldier,"A retired soldier (executioner, merchant) meets a hunter (butcher, tailor) on his way (in the forest). Together they pass the night in a house of robbers but their hostess warns them of the danger. At night the robbers return home and take their meal.

The first is the legend of Odysseus and Polyphemus (cf. Type 1137), in which he represents himself as the hero (who overpowers ghost-like cats). The second tells how he saved a child who was to be slaughtered by its mother and cooked and devoured by an ogress. To fool the ogress he had to hang himself on gallows among other corpses and allow the ogress to cut pieces of flesh from his body [K527]. The third adventure is a continuation of the second and tells how he himself was nearly devoured by the ogress. In the end he restores the child (and its mother) to its father. Because of his good deed the queen frees his three sons and rewards him [Q53]. In some variants the rescued child turns out to be the queens child."
1743,954,The Forty Thieves,"(Ali Baba). (Including the previous Type 676.) The tale consists of two parts: (1) A poor man (woodcutter) witnesses robbers entering into a mountain by pronouncing magic words like Open, sesame [D1552.2]. He then tries the formula [N455.3], enters the mountain, and finds a huge amount of gold [F721.4, N512] which he takes home. (2) His greedy brother, who lends him money scales, discovers his secret when a piece of gold remains in the scale [N478]. The brother goes to the mountain, but he is dismembered by the robbers because he forgets the formula for opening the mountain [N471]. At the request of his sister-in-law, the woodcutter fetches his brothers corpse, tells a cobbler to mend it and buries it. The robbers plan to take revenge. With the cobblers help they find the house of Ali Baba and mark it with a chalk circle, whereupon his maidservant (daughter) marks all other houses in the same way. The robber chief disguises himself as a merchant and asks the woodcutter for lodging for the night for himself and for his mules laden with jars (casks) of oil. When the maidservant goes to take some oil for her lamp, she realizes that only one jar is filled with oil, and that the robbers companions are hidden in the others [K312]. She heats the oil, pours it into the jars, and kills the robbers. The robber captain escapes and comes back in disguise (as a suitor). At dinner he asks for a meal without salt (in order not to be obliged to his host). Thereupon the maidservant becomes suspicious, recognizes the robber, and kills him. As her reward the woodcutter marries her to his son (nephew)."

When she reaches a house, animals (bird) warn her that it is a house of murderers and that she should go back (she gives food to watch dogs in order not to be betrayed). She finds corpses in the house. When she hears the robbers coming, she hides. Her bridegroom (the robbers) brings in a young woman, kills her, and cuts her into pieces. Her finger with a golden ring on it falls into her hiding place. The bride runs away at night and finds her way home safely (with the help of the marks on the path) where she reports to her family what she has seen. When the bridegroom comes to marry her, she recounts her adventure to her guests as a dream. As proof she shows the severed ring (finger) [H57.2.1]. The robbers are arrested and condemned or killed.

In a fish prepared for the guests, the key for his chains is found (cf. Type 736). Gregorius is elected pope, and when he enters Rome healing miracles take place. His mother makes a pilgrimage to Rome in order to confess her sins to the pope. They recognize each other [H151.3]. She enters a convent. After their death both gain spiritual salvation (Gregorius is worshiped as saint)."
1803,934,Tales of the Predestined Death (previously The Prince and the Storm),"(Including the previous Types 934A, 934A1, 934B, 934E, 934A*, 934A**, 934B*E*, 934E**, 937*, and 937A*.) This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with the prediction of a persons death. Examples: The time and manner of the future death [M341.1, M341.1.4] of a newborn child (adult) is forecast by norns [M301.12] (nurse, judge, etc. ; in dream). The parents of the child overhear the prophecy (they learn it from another person). Different manners of death are predicted: Death by natural forces (storm [M341.2.2], thunderstorm, falling tree), by an animal (wolf [M341.2.6], tiger, snake [M341.2.21], horse), by drowning [M341.2.3], when drinking water, when shearing sheep, by poisoning, on the wedding day [M341.1.1], by hanging [M341.2.21]. The three-fold death of a person caused by e.g. starving, burning and drowning [F901.1, F901.1.1, M341.2.4] is prophecied. Various precautions are taken in order to evade fate [M370] (the person is immured in a wall, isolated, hidden in a tower [M372]). Nevertheless the prophecy is fulfilled [M341.2, M370.1]. In some variants the predestined fate is averted (by a helper, stepmother, eagle, ruse). Cf. Types 506*, 899, 934D1."

1805,934C,Death Forestalls Evil Fates,"A mother mourns for her dead children. When she goes to church she realizes that the mass is being performed by dead relatives. Then she is shown at the altar what the evil fates of her children would have been (one son is on gallows, the other one is bound to a wheel) if they had not died [N121.2]. She thanks God for having taken her children."
1806,934D,934D1 Outwitting Fate,"A man overhears the fate predestined by a god [K1811.0.2] (goddess, soothsayer) decreeing that a boy (prince) will spend his life in poverty but will always own an ox (kill a stag every day) and that his sister will become a prostitute [N121.3]. When the boy grows up, the man advises him to sell his ox every day so that the god must furnish him a new one each day (to wait inside his hut so that the god must bring the stag to him). He advises the girl to demand a handful of pearls for her favors. The god must come in disguise each day because no man can pay such a price. The god soon tires of his duties and agrees to reverse the decrees of fate [K2371.2]."
1807,934D,Nothing Happens without God,An only son goes into military service and wants to take vengeance on the officers who recruited him. An old man (God) shows in spirit a new-born child with a gun and uniform. Now the youth understands that God has determined everyones fate [N121.1.1].
1808,934F,The Man in the Well,"A man fleeing from a unicorn falls into a well where a dragon lives. A tree grows beside the well, and, as he falls, the man grasps one of its branches. He finds two mice, one black and one white, gnawing at the branch, and sees snakes at the base of the tree. Observing all this, the man forgets his perilous position. When a drop of honey falls from the crown of the tree, he reaches to taste it (reaches for money that lies near him). The branch breaks and the man falls into the jaws of the dragon [J861.1]"
1809,934G,The False Prophecy,"An astrologer prophesies that a certain ruler will die within a year, but that he himself will live another twenty years. A knight kills the astrologer, thus discrediting his prophecies."
1810,934H,The Origin of Death,"This miscellaneous type consists of various tales dealing with the origin of death [A1335] and/or the time of death. Examples: (1) Formerly God let human beings die and return to life, but the moon died forever. A goat (hare) was sent by men to tell God [B291.2] that they wished to continue to live in this way. But the goat confounded the messages, and the dog [B291.2.1] arrived too late to change it [A1335.1.1]. Since that time, humans die forever. (2) God sends out a chameleon to tell humans that they should live forever (continue to live after death). On the way the chameleon is overtaken by a faster animal that delivers the opposite message [A1335.1]. (3) Formerly Death walked along singing [Z111], but he did not enter the houses of men. An old woman listened to him, liked his song, and repeated it. Thereupon Death followed the woman to her house and bedroom, and when she lay down (to have sexual intercourse) he strangled her. This is how Death first entered the houses of men. (4) In the year before they were to die, people neglected their responsibilities (they repaired their fences with temporary materials). Therefore, God decided that they should not know in advance when they will die [A1593]."
1811,934K,The Time Has Come but Not the Man,"A water spirit shouts three times from a river, The hour has passed and the man did not come [D1311.11.1]. The call is heard far outside the town. A young person runs to the river and drowns."
1812,935,The Prodigals Return,"A lazy (stupid) son leaves home and dissipates his fortune abroad. He becomes a soldier and asks his father for money by sending him a (three) letter pretending to have become a lieutenant (captain). The deception is discovered and the father expels his son. Through a trick (cleverness, magic) the young man makes his fortune and becomes king by marrying a princess [L161]. Rich and mighty, he decides to return home. On the way he is held up by robbers (he gambles away all his belongings). His companions are all killed, and he himself escapes, but he has to abandon his royal clothes. When he reaches his parents home in humble clothing [K1815], his father accuses him of lying and punishes and humiliates him (by forcing him to tend pigs, goats, sheep, geese). His wife (disguised as hermit, priest, bishop [K1837]) follows him, (overwhelms the robbers) and rescues him from the difficult situation. He then puts on his royal clothes, returns home, and proves his royal identity to his parents."
1813,935*,The Stepson Mariner,"A merchants stepson is sent to sea and makes his fortune. The merchants own son, living protected at home, has bad luck [N171]."
1814,936*,The Golden Mountain,"(Hasan of Basra.) A man hires himself out to a merchant (landlord) who promises high payment for unspecified labor. The merchant leads him to a high (golden) mountain that cannot be climbed. He (drugs him and) sews him up in an animal skin [K521.1.1]. Big birds carry him to the mountaintop as prey [B31.1]. There he slips out of the skin and throws precious stones (gold) down to the merchant. Later the merchant leaves him, helpless, behind on the mountain. Through lucky circumstances (passage under the earth, plunge into the sea) he escapes. Later he takes service with the same employer. When they arrive at the mountain again, the merchant is tricked into the animal skin and is carried up the mountain. After disclosing his identity to the merchant, the workman makes him throw precious stones down in the same way he had done before. Then he leaves the merchant on the mountain where he dies."
1815,938,Placidas,"(Eustacius.) Placidas, a colonel of the emperor Trajan, hunts a deer, between whose antlers a cross disclosed it to be Christ in animal form. His wife has a similar vision. Both are baptized together with their two sons. Placidas is named Eustacius, his wife Theopiste. When Eustacius rides again to the place of the vision, the deer reappears. Christ prophesies for him a period of suffering similar to that of Job. He can choose if he wishes to have the suffering now or at the end of his life [J214]. Eustacius decides to have it soon. When his servants and his animals die and all his property is stolen, he escapes with his family to Egypt. A boatman claims his wife as payment for the ferry; when Eustacius crosses a river with his two sons, the boys are carried off by a lion and a wolf [N251]. Farmers and shepherds take the animals prey and raise the boys. Eustacius works as farmhand. Many years later Eustacius is found by a legation of the emperor. They persuade him to return. When serving as colonel, he recovers his sons and his wife by chance [N121]. The new emperor in Rome wants them to make sacrifices to idols.

1818,938B,Better in Youth,"A married couple has to choose if they prefer to suffer in youth or in old age [J210, J214]. They decide to endure hardship in youth. The husband sells his wife (voluntarily, by force). The money is carried off by a bird [N527]. As a workman in a foreign land, he discovers the lost money in a felled tree in which the bird had built its nest. He is brought before the widowed queen, who recognizes him as her first husband. In some Jewish variants a couple can choose if they want seven good years now or in the future. The woman decides to have it now in order to educate her children. They receive money, most of which they give away as charity. At the end they are told that their good deeds have compensated for the bad years ahead."
1819,939,The Offended Deity,"A king offends a deity [C50]. He loses his kingdom and his fortune [C930] and is forced to wander for years in poverty. His wife is stolen from him. He must labor at menial tasks. Taken in and helped by a friend, he sees a valuable necklace disappear before his eyes. Knowing he will be suspected of the theft, he flees. He is bought as a slave and is ordered to throw corpses into a tank for a fee. His wife brings the corpse of their son. The king is eventually restored to his former position. His wife (and child) are restored to him."
1820,939A,Killing the Returned Soldier,The son of an innkeeper couple gains riches abroad and returns home. He shows his wealth but does not disclose his identity.

Type 935.
1821,940,The Three Suitors in the Cemetery (previously The Haughty Girl),"As proof of his love and his courage, a suitor is told to lie in a shroud in a coffin at the cemetery at night. Another must disguise himself as angel and perform a wake, and a third, disguised as the devil, has to carry away the coffin. When the angel and the devil start to fight, the pretended dead man jumps up. All three flee and thereby lose their chances of the promised sexual intercourse (marriage) [K1218.3]. In some variants an episode follows in which the men take revenge for the trick. In Swedish, Finnish, Flemish, German, and Swiss variants the rejected suitors disguise a beggar as prince and send him with coach and servant to the young woman to woo and marry her."
1822,940*,The Forgiven Debt,A farmer finds a sum of money which belongs to several gentlemen. With it he pays off the debt on his land. After ten years he confesses his guilt and wants to repay their money. They let him keep it all [Q68.2].
1823,944,King for a Year,"In a certain city it is the custom that a stranger who is not familiar with its laws is made king. At the end of his reign, all his possessions are taken from him and he is banished to an island. A wise man (who has been warned about this custom) arranges to send everything that he will need to the island (has a city built there), before his banishment [J711.3]. In some variants a dying ruler gives his son a golden ball (apple), telling him to give it to the greatest fool whom he can find.

1825,945,Luck and Intelligence,"This conglomerate tale type occurs in different forms. The Silent Princess frame with inset dilemma tales is common without the outer Luck and Intelligence frame. The various dilemma tales also occur without any frame. The outer frame is a dispute between Intelligence and Luck, as to which is the more powerful. As a test a shepherd (gardener, farmer) is endowed with intelligence. He participates in a suitor-test for a mute princess, who is offered in marriage to whoever can make her speak [H343]. The clever shepherd tells to the princess that end with a question [F954.2.1, Z16.1] (e.g. a carpenter, a taylor and a clergyman pass the night together. The carpenter carves a girl, the tailor dresses her, and the clergyman animates the figure [F1023, D435.1.1]. To whom does the girl belong [H621]). Cf. Types 653, 653A. When the princess continues to be silent, he starts to talk to objects or animals who answer wrongly (he himself) in order to tempt the princess to contradict them. Finally she breaks her silence. Cf. Types 559, 571574. But the king refuses to give the shepherd his daughter and condemns him to death. He is saved by Luck [N141], which means that Luck is more powerful than Intelligence."
1826,945A*,Money and Fortune,"(Including the previous Types 935**, 946C*, and 946D*.) Money and Fortune (Luck and Blessing) test their power on a poor man.The one who can make him richest will be the winner. Money gives the man money. Soon (three times) he loses all the money (when he is stung by wasps or because he hides it in a pot where his wife finds it and spends it). With Fortunes help he finds the money again. From then on the man believes in Fortune and becomes wealthy. Fortune has won the bet because where there is no good fortune, money is worth nothing [N183]. Cf. Type 736. In some variants the frame tale is missing. A poor man (rope-maker, beggar) is given a sum of money three times. Two times he loses the money because of unfortunate circumstances (a bird carries it away; his wife unwittingly sells the pot where it is hidden, he accidentally drops it in the river; he forgets the hiding place). The third time he recovers everything because of lucky circumstances, or he finds his fortune in an object which to all appearances seemed worthless (he receives a fish in whose belly a diamond is hidden) [N183, N421] (cf. Type 736). (Previously Types 935** and 946D*.)"

When the poor man reaches that place, he closes his eyes (to feel how a blind man feels when he walks) and so passes by the money without seeing it (he stumbles against the money, thinks it is a stone, and kicks it aside) [N351.2, Q34]. Cf. Types 735, 735A, 745A, and 834. In Chinese variants he fails to see the gold left in his way by God because he is too lazy to sweep away the dust that covers the gold. (Previously Type 842.) In some variants the man is followed by bad luck. (Previously Type 947A*.)"
1829,810,The Snares of the Evil One,"An unborn child is promised to the devil in a crisis [M211, S211, S241]. When some years later the promised child is to be fetched by the devil, he takes refuge in a holy place (church, altar, cemetery) in a magic circle reading the bible (clergyman draws a ring around him) [K218.1]. The devil cannot tempt him outside the circle [D1381.11, G303.16.19.15] so the contract is voided. Cf. Types 400, 518, 974."
1830,810A,The Devil Does Penance,"A poor pious man puts his last piece of bread on a tree stump. A young devil steals the bread in order to test him. The pious man blesses the thief.

The devil has objects which appear different from what they really are [H523], and the man must guess their real nature: he-goat horse, cloth goat-skin, gold cup cup of pitch, roasted meat dead dog, spoon whale-rib, wineglass horses hoof. Or the devil asks seemingly impossible questions: what is sweeter than honey [H671], softer than swans-down [H672], harder than stone [H673] Or he asks for the symbolic meaning of the numbers one to seven (ten, twelve) [H602.1.1, Z22] (cf.

When St. Peter asks how the girl should be rewarded, Christ answers that the two people should marry, for then they would complement one another."
1856,822*,The Mythical Creditor (previously The Devil Lends Money to the Man),"A supernatural being (devil) lends money to a poor man on the condition that he will claim the mans soul if the man does not repay the debt within one year. When the poor man comes to pay his debt, the supernatural being is no longer there (is dead, is killed by lightning or has been disappeared secretly) [K231.4]. In some variants the farmer avoids having to repay his debt to the devil by giving excuses, or he exempts himself from the obligation to pay by solving the devils riddles (cf. Type 812), by destroying the written agreement, or by giving the devil a brooding hen instead of his mother or his pungent smell instead of his soul."
1857,823A*,A Mother Dies of Fright when she Learns that she Was About to Commit Incest with her Son,"A mother (of Solomon) has a rendezvous with a young man. Her son (Solomon) disguises himself and goes to the meeting place instead of the young man in order to test her chastity [N383.3, T412.2]. (The mother caresses him and he denounces her. She curses him: the tree should swallow him. Solomon carves a violin while sitting inside the tree.) Cf. Type 920A*."
1858,824,The Devil Lets the Man See his Wifes Unfaithfulness,"He transforms the husband into a goat which he brings to see his wife and her lover [K1531]. In some variants the devil (wood spirit) shows a man how false his wife is by bringing her a sack of gold. In order to keep the money, she agrees to cut off the head of her sleeping husband. The man awakes in time and punishes his wife. Cf. Type 921B."
1859,825,The Devil in Noahs Ark [K485],"This miscellaneous type comprises various anecdotes dealing with the devil in Noahs ark. The motifs mentioned do not all occur in any single variant. God commands Noah to build the ark in secret to escape the deluge [A1015, A1021]. In order to keep the work secret, the hammer is silent or the axe never gets dull on the stone chopping block [H1199.13, cf. H1116.1, F837]. The devil finds out the secret of the construction of the ark from Noahs wife. He persuades her to give Noah an intoxicating drink [K2213.4.2], so Noah tells his secret and the devil destroys the ark [cf. G303.14.1.1, K2213.4]. Noah weeps and an angel instructs him how to rebuild it. By performing a washing ritual (water circle) Noah is able to keep the devil away from the ark. A gong calls the animals to board the ark. Some creatures are barred but finally they all enter: the serpent [A2145.2], the insects, the fly [A2031.2], fabulous creatures like the unicorn [A2214.3], the phoenix [A2232.4] and the giant [F531.5.9]. By a ruse the devil manages to enter the ark: he hides near Noahs wife (at her breast, in her work-basket, in her shadow). She does not enter the ark until Noah calls her with a curse addressed to the devil [C12.5.1, K485]. On board, the devil, in the form of a mouse, gnaws a hole in the ark and tries to sink it [A1853.1], but a cat swallows the mouse. Helpful animals (serpent, hare, fish, dog) offer to close the hole with part of their body (tail, nose); smaller animals (tortoise, salamander, rabbit) are used as a plug. The serpent demands fresh (human) blood every day for its help. After the deluge, Noah throws the serpent into a holy fire. Its ashes spread with the wind and turn into bloodsucking fleas (lice, mosquitos) [A2001]."
1860,826,List of Sins on Cowhide (previously Devil Writes down Names of Men on Hide in Church) [G303,"24.1.3]. A pious clergyman has a vision in church: he sees the devil at the altar writing down all the sins of the participants of the mass. In the name of God he takes the list, reads it to the community, and everyone repents. The devil leaves the church."
1861,850,The Birthmarks of the Princess,"A princess is promised in marriage to whoever is able to describe her birthmarks [H51.1, H525]. A young swineherd (shepherd, tailor) has hogs (geese) that dance to his magic flute. In return for his dancing hogs the princess lets the shepherd boy see her naked and thus he comes to know her secret birthmarks [K1358, K443.6]. Or a fisherman offers the princess colorful fishes. In return she undresses herself three times, so that finally he knows the answer. Another suitor (rich man) guesses the answer. As both rivals have solved the riddle, the king then gives a further test: the princess is to marry the suitor to whom she turns in the night [H315]. The rivals sleep with her and she turns to the shepherd (because his rival has eaten bad-smelling food or has soiled the bed). Cf. Types 851, 852, and 857."
1862,851,The Princess who Cannot Solve the Riddle,"(Including the previous Types 851A and 876.) A princess is offered in marriage to whoever can pose a riddle that she cannot solve [H342, H551]. A man (prince, stupid boy, shepherd) makes a riddle based on unusual circumstances which he has witnessed (experienced) [H565]. (She marries him at this point and the tale ends here.) She sends her maidservants and then goes herself to him at night to learn the answer. He keeps her nightdress (braid) as proof [H81.2, H117]. In court, she answers his riddle but permits him to ask another. It refers to her night visit, and rather than answer it, she agrees to marry him. Different riddles are used, for example: (1) I ride on my father and wear (carry) my mother he has sold his parents and bought a horse and clothes (gun). (2) I ate (am) the unborn [H792] (cf. Type 927) a fetal animal (he was cut from his mothers womb). (3) I drank water from neither heaven nor earth horses sweat (condensation from a lamp). (4) One killed three and three killed twelve [H802] his horse was poisoned, birds ate it, thieves ate the birds, and all died. In Turandot the princess herself is the one to set riddles for her suitors to answer [H540.2]: riddle of the sun [H762], of the ocean [H734] of the year [H721.1]. If they are not able to find the solution they will be punished by death. (Previously Type 851A, an Oriental literary tale.)"
1863,852,"Lying Contest (previously The Hero Forces the Princess to Say, That is a Lie)","A princess is offered in marriage to the man who can tell so big a lie that she (her father) will exclaim, That is a lie [H342.1]. A suitor tells impossible tales of his extraordinary great ox [X1237], of a tree that grows to the sky overnight [F54.2], of a river of honey [X1547.2], of his ascent and descent on a rope of chaff from the sky [X1757], of a great cabbage [X1423.1], stable [X1547.2, X1036.1], animals [X1201], mushroom [X1424], large man [X920], a man who cuts off his head and replaces it [X1726.2], a man who cuts ice with his own hands [X1858] or of a man who drinks water from his skull [X1739.2]. When finally the suitor states that her father served his father as swineherd (when he threatens to report [falsely] her amorous conduct [K1271.1.]), the princess (king) is brought to say the required words and she has to marry the suitor."
1864,853,The Hero Catches the Princess with her Own Words,"(Including the previous Type 860A*.) A princess is offered in marriage to any man who outwits her in repartee [H507.1]. On the way to the contest the youngest of three brothers (stupid boy, suitor) picks up rubbish: a dead crow, an egg, and other objects. The (two) elder brothers fail in talking to the princess. The youngest brother, by producing these objects at the proper time, is able to give an eloquent (often obscene) answer to each of the princess questions [H507.1.0.1]. He wins her as his bride. In some variants he is imprisoned and escapes by means of his magic tablecloth [D1395.2], magic purse [D1395.3] and magic fiddle [D1415.2.5]. He uses his magic fiddle to capture the princess and will release her only if she says, No to all his questions [K1331, Type 853A]. By this means he wins her to his desires and marries her [L161]."
1865,853A,No,"A king with a daughter of a marriageable age is told about the conversation of three of his officers (suitors, young men, soldiers). One says that he intends to love the queen, another wants to sleep with the princess, the third wants gold. The first gets nothing, the third receives the gold. Then the king advises his daughter that she must answer all the questions of the second suitor (suitors who wanted to sleep with the princess) with No. By a clever framing of his questions the suitor overcomes her resistance and marries her (the princess agrees to the suitors question by saying No) [K1331]. Cf. Types 851, 853."
1866,854,The Golden Ram,"A young man (soldier) writes on a wall (states), Money is all powerful (With money one can even win the princess). The king is provoked and sets what he believes to be an impossible task. The young man receives as much money as he wants, but within a certain time he has to seduce (find) the princess [H322]. If he fails he will be condemned to death. The princess is hidden in a secret place (tower, room under earth, island, secret room, iron palace at the bottom of the sea) and guarded. The young man demands a hollow golden (silver, copper) animal statue (ram, goat, lion, deer, elephant, ox, horse, dancing bear, bird, eagle) and hides inside it [K1341.1]. The king buys the statue (which can play music) and installs it in his daughters room as entertainment. At night the youth steals out of the statue and amuses himself with the princess. When the statue is damaged it has to be sent for repair, and the youth comes out. Having won the contest the youth may now marry the princess (after she has become pregnant or has given birth to his child). In some variants a king offers his daughter to whoever is able to find her. Three sons of a merchant travel and reach the town where the contest is held. Two of them fail to find the princess and are killed. The third, on the advice of an old woman, orders a hollow golden animal, inside of which he is carried into the secret hiding place of the princess. When the statue is damaged it is taken back. In this way the suitor comes out again and is able to describe the way to the princess hiding place (to show a token) to the king. Or, the suitor has to recognize the princess among several similar looking girls or animals; the princess helps him by giving a sign [H161, H161.1]."
1867,855,The Substitute Bridegroom,"A handsome youth is hired to take the place of a one-eyed (crippled) prince (merchants son) at the latters wedding. The bride falls in love with the youth and refuses the one-eyed prince [K19.5.3]. In some variants the young man escapes with the bride. Or, the one-eyed prince is tested. He cannot remember the conversation between the bride and the youth on the preceding night [H17]. Sometimes the bride searches for the young man and eventually finds him. She gives alms to all passers-by [H11.1.1], until eventually she recognizes her husband. In other variants the bride offers a reward to all those who tell her a story. The young man appears and tells his story [H11]. Or, the youth has left his name (a verse) with the bride. In numerous variants it is predicted that the young man will die at the age of twelve (sixteen) [M341.1] but he outwits this fate. Cf. Types 870, 934."
1868,856,The Man with Four Wives (previously The Girl Elopes With the Wrong Man),"A youth is driven away by his father when he states that he will marry four wives [M373]. While acting as a servant, the youth pretends to be unable to read [K1816.0.3]. He is given a message and learns that the princess intends to elope with the son of a court official [K1317.9]. He informs the court official who locks up his son. The youth takes his place and elopes with the princess [K1371.1, N318.2]. At daybreak the princess realizes she cannot return to her parents. The young man is bitten by a snake and restored to life [E0] by a girl whom he marries. In the form of a parrot [D638.1, T33] he is bought by another princess, whom he marries as well. Forced to flee, he hides in the house of a rich merchant and marries his daughter. Finally he returns to his father with his four wives. Cf. Type 725."
1869,857,The Louse-Skin,"A louse that has been found on a princess (king) is fattened to an enormous size (becomes as big as a sheep, calf, ox) [B873.1, F983.2; cf. Type 1960M] and slaughtered. The king (princess, queen) displays the skin in public (has a dress, shoes, gloves made from it; has a chair or drum covered with it; has the louses meat prepared) and announces, that whoever guesses the kind of animal the skin belongs to [H522.1.1] will receive half of the kingdom and also the princess in marriage [H511]. A (disguised) monster (real or false beggar, shepherd, animal, disguised robber, devil, cannibal ogre), who learns the secret by trickery [H573.3], guesses correctly and wins the princess. (Previously Type 621.) In some variants the princess is rescued from the monsters power. She escapes with a magic flight (with the assistance of supernatural or skillful helpers)."
1870,859,The Penniless Bridegroom Pretends to Wealth [K1917],"(Including the previous Types 859A 859D and 881**.) A penniless suitor pretends to be wealthy by boasting and manages to marry the daughter of a rich man. Cf. Types 545D*, 1455, 1459**, 1590, and 1688. This tale exists chiefly in five different forms: (1) A rich man wants to marry his daughter only to a rich man. A poor suitor (sometimes two) pretends to be rich by disguising himself and telling lies to the girls father. When the father is ready to marry him to his daughter the suitor burns a wooden tower and pretends that all his riches have vanished in the fire. Sometimes the bride exposes him by visiting him incognito in his home. (2) After the marriage the bridegroom takes his bride to show her his land. He puts on soiled (patched) clothes. When she looks at the land he points to a patch in his jacket (trousers) saying, This patch is mine! [K1917.1]. (Often combined with [3]). (Previously Type 859A.) (3) An uncle wants a wife for his nephew. He gives the boy a coin and food to hold while he makes the arrangement. He tells the girls father that his nephew has money in his hand and plenty to eat. So he wins the girl [K1917.2]. (Often combined with [2]). (Previously Type 859B.) (4) When a servant boasts that his house has 150 lights and a goat-pen, his master marries his daughter to him. Arriving at his home they realize that the lights are the stars shining through the cracks in the roof and one goat is tied to a tree [K1917.4]. (Previously Type 859C.) (5) A suitor touches his whiskers saying, All of these are mine!, whereupon the girl thinks he is referring to the fields and livestock which they are riding past [K1917.7]. (Previously Type 859D.)"

1879,900,King Thrushbeard,"A princess refuses all (one) who come to her as suitors [H311] without giving a reason. She ridicules them and calls them ugly names (Thrushbeard) [T74.0.1, T76]. Her father, angry at this behavior, decides that she has to marry the next man who comes [T62], even if he is a beggar. The last rejected wooer decides to take revenge. He appears disguised as a beggar [K1816.0.3, K1817.1] (in arrangement with her father) and the princess is forced into marriage [T72.2.1] (the beggar purchases the right to spend three nights with her [T45, K1361]; she becomes pregnant).

On the way to the church she talks to her horse [H13.1], to the bridge, and to the church-door [H13.2], and thus reminds the prince of his first love. After the wedding he gives her different objects or she loses things which the second bride had given to her (glove, muffler, necklace, ring, belt) [H151.5]. The prince picks everything up. When in the evening the prince tests his wifes identity by demanding that she repeat their conversation on the way to church [H15.1] she cannot recall it without consulting the maidservant. When he demands to see the necklace [H92] (when he asks for the objects he had collected), the truth comes to light. He sends the second woman away and marries his faithful princess [K1911.3]. Cf. Types 403, 533, and 870A."
1899,870A,The Goose-Girl (Neighbors Daughter) as Suitor (previously The Little Goose-Girl),"A poor girl (neighbors girl) is determined to marry a prince [T55], who thinks this is an absurd idea. In vain he tries to make her understand that her plans are senseless. When he is about to marry a bride in accordance with his rank, the poor girl takes the place of his new bride in the marriage bed [K1843.1]. The prince discovers the substitution (by the ornaments given to her [H90] or by a stone indicating chastity [H411.1]), but nevertheless he accepts the poor scorned girl as his wife. Cf. Types 403, 533, 870, 874, and 879. In the oldest variant from the northern area, a goose-girl declares to a prince that she intends to marry him even if he refuses. When the prince finds a bride of his own rank, the goose-girl warns her about a stone which will reveal her past sexual experiences. The bride asks the goose-girl to substitute for her during the wedding night. Nevertheless the stone reveals the truth about the brides lost virginity and the prince finally accepts the goose-girl as his true bride. In the southern variants, a neighbors daughter believes (because of a prophecy) that she will marry a bey (shah, prince). When he learns about her idea he mocks her. When he marries a woman of his own rank the neighbors daughter is asked to substitute for the bride on the wedding night, because the bride had run away (was ugly or was not a virgin). Through special signs he discovers the deception and finally accepts the neighbors daughter as his legal wife."
1900,871,Princess and Ogress,"A princess who looks into a forbidden chamber [C611] sees a mans picture and falls in love [T11.2]. A magician in bird form brings the princess at night to her lover. Once they stay too late. The sun sees them, so that the magician bursts and dies [D567]. The girl, left alone, becomes a servant in the palace, where she is threatened by a cannibal princess [G11.3]. She escapes through a narrow window and goes down a well which leads her to the underworld [F93.0.2.1] where she meets the chief of devils boiling the brains of the ogress princess [D2065.4]. The heroine turns the pot upside down [C325] and returns to the well. The ogress is now normal. As a reward for her good deed the heroine is sent to her lovers house, where she arrives just as he is about to marry another [N681.1]. He recognizes the princess and marries her. Cf. Type 475."
1901,871*,The Princess Who Goes to Seek Trouble [H1376,"5]. She loses her way in the forest, hides in a tree. A hunter camps under the tree. His dogs reveal the princesss hiding place, and she is forced to come down. The hunter sleeps by her side, holding her plaits tightly in his hands. By cutting off her hair, the princess, unnoticed, makes her escape [K538]. In Russian variants the hunter pretends to be a sick girl. By ordering the young women to assemble, he recognizes the one who passed the night with him and marries her."
1902,871A,The Unfaithful Queen,"(Including the previous Type 1511.) A woman goes to a kings garden (underworld) and sees the queen meet a black lover (beggar, cripple) [T232]. She denounces the queen and eventually marries the king. Or a friend of the king (another person) follows her and sees everything. On the order of her lover, the queen murders her husband.

1903,872*,Brother and Sister,"A brother is married to an evil jealous wife [K2212.2] who slanders his sister [K2112] (accuses her of illicit sexual behavior) and expels her into the woods [S143]. Thanks to the advice of an ogress (water spirit, bird, giant woman) whom she meets there, the sister survives, proves her innocence, and marries a prince [L162]."
1904,873,The King Discovers his Unknown Son,"A king (in disguise, unrecognized) leaves a token (ring) with a woman (widow) with whom he has passed the night. If she gives birth to a son she is to give him the token [T645]. The boy, mistreated because he is a bastard, goes to search for his unknown father [H1381.2.2.1.1]. He becomes a baker and has a liaison with a noble girl. The king (his father) orders his execution. Just before the execution the token is discovered and the son is recognized as the son of the king [N731, H80]. The king marries the boys mother [L162]."
1905,874,The Proud King is Won,"A woman (princess, the youngest of three daughters) falls in love with a king (prince) whom she knows only from hearsay. She writes to him (has a letter or message sent by her father). But the king scorns and rejects her. (When she tells him that she weeps for him, he sends her a handkerchief; when she tells him that she intends to hang herself, he sends her a rope; when she threatens to commit suicide, he sends her a knife or dagger.)

1906,874*,Ariadnes Thread (previously Ariadne-thread Wins the Prince),A king promises his son to whatever woman can find her way through the 1000 rooms in his palace. A poor but clever girl succeeds by unwinding a spool of thread [R121.5.].
1907,875,The Clever Farmgirl [J1111,"4]. This type combines various introductory episodes with a common main part. Introductions: (1) A king looks for a wife and/or meets a clever girl by chance. (2) The father of the girl finds a golden mortar in a field and, against the advice of his clever daughter, takes it to the king who demands the pestle as well [H561.1.2]. (3) A quarrel between a farmer and a nobleman in court is settled by giving both riddles to be solved [H630H659]. The daughter of the farmer gives the right answers [H561.1, H583.7, H583.9, H641.1, H631.3, H632, H633, H636, H583.8]. (4) A king finds a girl in a house. When he asks her about her relatives she answers with wit and cleverness. Main part: The clever girl has to perform various tasks set by the king [H373, H712, H1050H1055, H1057, H1058, H1061H1065, H1010, H1022.1, H1024.1, H1024.1.1, H1021.6.1, H1021.1, H1023.9, H1023.7, H1023.1, H951, J1191.2, H1152.1, H1185, H601]: she must come to the king neither naked nor clad, neither by horse nor on foot. She should estimate the value of the kings beard or weave a cloth with only a few threads. Or she has to make boiled eggs hatch [J1191.2, H1023.1.1] (cf. Type 821B) or carve a fowl and give appropriate pieces to all members of the family (cf. Type 1533). The king marries the girl [L162] but orders her not to meddle in his affairs. When he settles a dispute between two farmers unjustly, she advises the wronged man to show the king the absurdity of his decision by an equally foolish act [J1191.1]. When the king casts her out and allows her only to take with her the one thing she holds dearest [J1545.4], she takes her sleeping husband with her and thus moves him to forgive her."
1908,875*,The Women of Weinsberg,"When Weinsberg is besieged, the king permits the women to leave and to take with them whatever they can carry (whatever is dearest to them [J1545.4]). Each woman carries her (sleeping, drunken) husband out of the city. When the soldiers see what is happening, they try to prevent it. They appeal to the king. He appreciates the womens clever plan and declares that his promise to the women must be kept [J1545.4.1]. Cf. Type 875."
1909,875A,Girls Riddling Answer Betrays a Theft,"(Including the previous Type 873*.) A prince sends his servant to a clever girl with a round tart, thirty cakes, and a capon, and asks the girl if it is the full moon, if it is the thirtieth of the month, and if the rooster has crowed in the evening. She replies that it is not full moon, that it is the fifteenth of the month and that the rooster has gone to the mill; but that the prince should spare the pheasant for the partridges sake. She thus shows him that the servant has stolen half the tart, half of the cakes, and the capon [H582.1.1]."
1910,875B,The Clever Girl and the King,"(Including the previous Types 875B1875B4.) The contents and combinations of the impossible tasks and their countertasks vary in the numerous variants of this type, where a person imposes an impossible task on someone who, in return, imposes an equally absurd countertask. (1) A prince (king) makes an impossible demand [H1010]: Three unwed girls (virgins) should all give birth to a child at the same time (within nine months). Being summoned to the palace they present themselves disguised as pregnant women by hiding cushions under their dresses. When they are granted a wish, the youngest sister asks for roasted snow [H951, J2121]. Being unable to produce it, the prince realizes the absurdity of his own demand and marries the girl. (2) A king imprisons an adviser and will release him only on the condition that he brings a horse that is neither black nor white, neither gray nor reddish brown. The adviser claims to have such a horse at home, but the king cannot fetch it on any day of the week. The king sees the absurdity of his own demand and releases his prisoner. (3) A prince finds a block of white marble so beautiful that he orders his tailor to sew him a suit out of the stone [H1021.9]. No tailor in the kingdom can do this and he orders them all to be killed. Finally an elderly tailor is asked to make the suit. On the advice of his granddaughter he asks the prince for meat made of mud and a cake of snow for lunch. Thus he points to his masters own absurd task, whereupon the prince recognizes his mistake and marries the granddaughter. (4) A king orders his adviser (boy) to bring him bulls milk [H1024.1] or to have a bull bear a calf. The advisers daughter pretends that her father has given birth to a child [H1024.1.1.1, J1533] and the king thus sees the absurdity of his order. (Previously Type 875B1.) (5) A Muslim king orders his adviser to convert him into a Hindu. The adviser stands by the road rubbing a donkey. When the king asks why, the adviser explains that he is trying to change it into a horse (cow). The king thus sees the absurdity of his order [J1536.2]. (Previously Type 875B2.) (6) A king orders his adviser to move a well. On the advice of his daughter, the adviser tells the king that the king must help by sending him the well. The king thus sees the absurdity of his order [H1023.25.1]. (Previously Type 875B3.) (7) The king asks a farmer for a tribute of calves born to bulls. The farmers son replies, Let me go and ask my father who is guarding the fields, lets fish come up from the seashore and eat the millet. (Previously Type 875B4.) (8) Other impossible tasks that occur in some variants are: growing onions out of a stone, winding a rope of chaff [H1021.2] (cf. Type 1174), making a rope of sand [H1021] (cf. Type 1174), counting the leaves of the flowers or the stars in the sky, measuring the sky, sewing a millstone, drying snow on the stove [J2121, cf. Type 1270], drying a candle [J2122] (cf. Type 1270). Cf. Types 1172, 1271A*."
1911,875B*,Storytelling Saves a Wife from Death (Sheherazade),"A king who discovers that his wife is unfaithful has her executed. Then, each night, he takes a new wife and has her killed the following day (after she gives birth) (cf. Type 1426). After three years (one year) the vizier is unable to find a suitable woman, so the king condemns him to death. The viziers daughter volunteers to marry the king (although her father objects). She tells stories to the king (with the help of her sister, or a courtier tells the stories) [J1185.1]. The king postpones the execution. After ayear of storytelling (after the wife gives birth), the king realizes that it would be wrong to kill this woman."
1912,875D,The Clever Young Woman at the End of the Journey,"She explains various enigmatic statements and actions encountered by people on the way [H586, H586.1H586.7]. Finally she succeeds in a contest in repartee and in performing impossible tasks. A (dried) fish laughs in the palace [D1318.2.1]. The king orders his vizier (a man) on pain of death to find out why (to solve another problem). The vizier (his son) sets out on a journey. He meets an old man and makes various enigmatic suggestions (two men travel together and one makes enigmatic suggestions). Let us carry one another, means, Let us tell stories to shorten the way. Let us get horses in the forest, means, Let us cut walking sticks. Or, one man does seemingly absurd things e.g. he wears his shoes in the streams and carries them on dry land. The mans daughter correctly interprets the enigmatic remarks or the seemingly absurd actions [H586]. Finally the viziers son marries the girl because she answers the original question [H561.1.1.1]: The fish laughed because there was a man dressed in womans clothes in the harem."
1913,875D*,The Princes Seven Wise Teachers,"A prince goes to seven wise teachers to be educated. When he comes back to the palace he pretends to be mute (on the advice of his teachers). The princes stepmother makes advances to her stepson, and then accuses him to his father [K2111], who condemns the prince to death. The seven wise men and the queen argue the case by telling stories for seven days [J1185]. In some variants the prince (on advice of his tutors) proves to his father, that one of the queens maidservants is a man dressed as a woman [K1836]. The queen and her lover are hanged (and the princes innocence is proved)."
1914,875E,The Unjust Decision: The Oil Press Gives Birth to a Foal,"A traveler ties his mare to an oilmans mill. During the night the mare gives birth to a foal. The oilman claims it, saying the mill (vehicle, pale, crutched stick) has given birth to the foal. Or, a rich neighbor claims a calf (from his poor neighbor, who owns the cow) saying that his ox had given birth to it. The judge (jackal) has to decide the case. He arrives late, explaining that the sea was burning and that he had to put the fire out with straw (other absurd explanations). Thus the absurdity of the oilmans claim becomes clear (and the traveler may keep the foal) [J1191]. Cf. Types 821B, 875, 920A, and 1804B."
1915,877,The Old Woman who Was Skinned,"(La Vecchia Scorticata.) An ugly old maid succeeds in marrying her old and ugly sister to a king (prince) who wants to marry a young woman. In order to hide the ugliness of his bride, she shows the prince only her fingers through the key-hole and the sound of her voice. On the wedding night he discovers the deception and throws the bride out of the window where she is caught in a tree. Some fairies observe this and laugh at the dangling old woman. The fairies, grateful for the amusement they have had, recompense the old woman by rejuvenating her into a beautiful girl [D1880]. The king marries her. Being jealous of her sisters fortune, the other old maid asks her how she became young. The latter, fearing another ruse of her sisters, explains that she has been skinned. She advises her sister have a barber skin her (the sister has herself skinned and dies)."
1916,879,The Basil Maiden,"(The Sugar Doll, Viola.) A prince (young man) passing by asks a girl who is watering her basil plant (ridiculing her) how many leaves her plant has. The girl answers with a counterquestion: How many stars does the sky have [H702, H705.3]. The prince does not know the answer and continues on his way ashamed. The next day he returns masked as a merchant (fisherman) and sells something precious to the girl in return for a kiss. Or, the prince repeatedly pricks the girl with a needle; she complains of insect bites. The next day the prince mocks the girl or reveals the deceit (the kiss and the pricking) to her. Next the girl disguises herself as a doctor [K1837] (death, angel of death), pays a visit to the prince who is feeling sick, and mistreats (mocks) him or makes him believe that death has come to him. Disguised as merchant the girl sells something to the prince on the condition that he kisses his donkey under the tail (his horses leg). The prince marries the girl, intending to avenge himself by killing her on the wedding night. But she puts a life-sized doll made of sugar (syrup) in her place [K525.1] and hides herself under the bed. When the prince destroys the doll with a sword-thrust and accidentally tastes its sweet blood, he regrets his deed. (The girl comes out of her hiding place and they are reconciled to one another.) Cf. Type 883B."
1917,879*,King Serves his Future Wife,"A king in disguise [K1812] overhears three (two) (poor) girls expressing their wishes [N455.3, N467]. The youngest declares that even if the king would like to marry her, he would have to serve her first. The king fulfills the wishes of the elder ones and punishes (imprisons, condemns to death) the youngest. The clever girl escapes (is saved) and/or finds a treasure (and builds a castle). Dressed in new clothes she makes the king fall in love [K1310] and serve her [N699.6]. She discloses her identity and they marry."
1918,879A,Fisher Husband of the Princess,"A princess falls in love with a very beautiful fishermans son and wants to marry him. The boy, worried about his low social standing, warns her that if she ever reproaches him for his social status, he will never talk again. On the wedding night the princess mocks him for his clumsy manners. He leaves her immediately and takes employment at the kings court. The king, impressed by his beauty, regrets that he cannot speak and promises a reward to whoever succeeds in making him talk again; failure will be punished by death. The princess comes disguised as a man (doctor). For three nights she tries in vain to cure him [H1194.0.1] and is finally led to the gallows. The boy (her husband), who is one of the spectators at her execution, speaks to her (in a very degrading way) at the very last moment and so saves her life. Cf. Types 434, 514, 514**, and 884."
1919,750*,Hospitality Blessed,"God (and St. Peter) rewards the hospitable farmer and punishes the inhospitable one [K1811, Q2]. Cf. Types 750B, 750D. In some versions (mostly Hungarian and Czech) a poor woman offers soup to Christ and St. Peter [K1811]. They reward the woman because they appreciate the specks of fat as stars in the soup. When the neighbor woman asks Christ and St. Peter to eat her soup, it is covered with fat and the woman is not rewarded at all."

A poor farmer who receives them hospitably is granted three good wishes; a rich man, who refused hospitality, receives three evil wishes [D1761.0.2, Q1.1]. Cf. Types 330, 471. The generous poor person uses his three wishes wisely; the selfish rich man makes two foolish wishes [J2071, J2073] (his horses neck broken, his wife stuck to the saddle) and must use the third to undo them. (The same with one wish: to keep doing all day what you begin [J2072.3]; one gets good linen all day, while the other throws water on a pig [D2172.2].) Or, a husband given three wishes transfers one to his wife who wastes it on a trifle. In his anger he wishes the desired article in her body and must use the third wish to get it out [J2075]."
1922,750B,Hospitality Rewarded,"After Christ and St. Peter [K1811] (pious beggar) have been refused hospitality in a house where a wedding is taking place, they are received hospitably in a poor mans house.

The helpers are blessed for their assistance [A2711.3, A2711.4.3, A2221.5, Q46.1]. (2) In the corn-legend a farmer tricks the men (soldiers) who pursue the Holy Family by telling them that the fugitives passed by when a field of grain, which is now ripe, was sown.

This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A knight who had plundered the property of St. Clement is attacked at night in his bedroom by an army of mice. Unable to ward them off, he prays to be hung in a chest from the ceiling. The mice go away. When the chest is taken down, the knight is found inside gnawed to death by other mice. Or, the Polish King Popiel flees from mice to a wooden tower on an island. Even there the mice find him and kill him. (2) A prominent cleric (Archbishop Hatto I or II) levies taxes during a famine and demands that those who do not pay (the poor) be burned to death. As they die, he likens their cries to the sound of squealing rats (mice). God punishes him for this cruel deed by plaguing him with mice. In order to get rid of the mice, the bishop flees to a tower on a rock in the Rhine (near Bingen). The mice attack him even there and eat him up."
1939,751G*,Bread Turned to Stone,"(Including the previous Type 368*.) This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with bread (that has not been shared during a famine [Q272]) that is turned to stone [D471.1, D661, M411.2] (and/or gives forth blood [D474]). Examples: (1) A poor woman asks her sister for bread for her children. The sister hides her bread and refuses, saying, If I had any bread, I would rather wish it would turn to stone. Immediately, her bread turns into stone. (When her husband later tries to cut the bread she had hidden, blood flows from it.) (2) A lay brother (baker) hides his bread instead of giving any to the poor. It turns to stone, and is hung on the church door as a warning."
1940,752A,Christ and St,"Peter in the Barn. Christ and St. Peter spend the night in a farmers barn [K1811]. As payment for lodging the farmer wants them to thresh. They separate the grain by means of fire. When the farmer tries to do the same, he burns the grain and the barn [J2411]. Cf. Types 750D, 791."
1941,752B,The Forgotten Wind,"God charges a pious man (St. Peter) with the task of managing the weather. The man sends rain, sun and heat to earth but he forgets the wind. Thereupon God deprives him of his responsibility [J755.1]. Cf. Type 800."
1942,752C,The Prodigious Mower,"A saint (God, devil) has to mow a field in exchange for a dinner. He mows so hard that he is believed to be the devil (other mowers become jealous and put some laxative in his soup). Or, when threshing corn he breaks his anvil into two parts."
1943,753,Christ and the Smith,"Christ (St. Peter, St. Eligius, saint) visits [K1811] a haughty smith [F663.0.1], takes off a horses foot in order to shoe it, and replaces the foot [E782.4]. He rejuvenates an old woman by putting her in the fire [D1886, E121.2]. The smith tries to do the same with his old mother-in-law but only deforms her [J2411.1]. The smiths wife and daughter, both pregnant, are so shocked at seeing her that both give birth to a monkey. This explains the origin of monkeys [A1861.2]. In some variants the attempt at rejuvenation produces a monkey."
1944,753*,Christ (God) Turns a Thief into an Ass,An innkeeper intends to rob Christ (God) and St. Peter (saint) [K1811]. Christ turns him into a donkey [Q551.3.2.6] and gives him to another person for whom he must work. Later Christ restores him to human form and gives him the money he had earned as an ass.
1945,753A,Unsuccessful Resuscitation,"Christ (St. Peter, angel) resuscitates a dead princess (girl). A companion tries to do the same, fails, and is warned against trying again (is condemned and rescued by Christ). Cf. Types 330, 785."
1946,754,Lucky Poverty (previously The Happy Friar),"A poor man (cobbler, weaver, smith, porter, falconer) is happy despite of his meagre living conditions. A rich man, seeing this apparent contradiction, gives him money. The poor man worries about his new wealth and loses his former happiness. Finally he returns the money so as to be happy again [J1085.1]. Cf. Type 844."
1947,754**,St,"Peter and his Wife. Peter, having quarreled with his wife, stays out in front of his house in the rain. When the Lord asks him why he is outside, he lies and says that the house is full of smoke. The Lord enters. At the rear he finds St. Peters wife holding up a broom handle [T251.3]."
1948,755,Sin and Grace,"A woman (on the advice of an old woman, devil) prevents the birth of her illegitimate children [T572.1] by using magic to procure abortions (kills the children, marries only when infertile, makes a contract with the devil). Later her husband (priest, preacher) realizes that she throws no shadow [F1038, Q552.9] and casts her out as a sinner [Q251]. She cannot be pardoned until a rose grows from a stone table [F971.2, Q431.4]. A churchman takes the woman at night into the church. The (souls of the) unborn children appear one by one, whip (rend) her, and finally forgive her. When the woman returns home a rose springs up [F971.2]. (She dies or her body is torn up by animals.) Cf. Types 756A756C, 762, and 765."
1949,756,The Three Green Twigs,"Legends about a wooden stick that grows roots and twigs and becomes a cypress, etc. The central motif in Types 756A, 756B, and 756C."
1950,756A,The Self-Righteous Hermit,"A hermit mistrusts divine justice, or a man who thinks he is without sin complains about Gods decision of his place after death (punishment [hell) or reward [heaven]). Cf. Types 756B, 756C. This tale exists chiefly in four different forms: (1) An angel ceases to appear to a hermit [Q553.2] because he spoke disparagingly of an evil-doer who was taken to the gallows. Thereupon the hermit has to do hard penance [L435.1] by wandering about as a beggar with a small dry branch [Q521.1]. The hermit converts a band of robbers with the story of his misfortune. The next morning the hermit is found dead, with green twigs on his small dry branch [F971.1] (2) A discontented hermit, an evil-doer, and a naked man covered with sand worry about their place in heaven. Angel Gabriel tells them Gods answers to their questions: the place of the hermit will be in hell because he doubts Gods justice, the evil-doer will be in heaven because of his hospitality, and even the sand will be removed from the naked man because of his ingratitude and impatience. (3) A criminal has to do penance after confession: every time he passes a crucifix he should say the Lords prayer. When doing so he is killed by the relative of one of his former victims. The hermit, his father confessor, sees that the criminal is taken into heaven by angels, and he decides to leave Gods service. When he leaves his cell, he breaks his neck and is taken by the devil. (4) A murderer overhears the confession of a dying hermit. In despair the criminal utters a fast prayer regretting not having lived a life like the pious hermits. The hermit hears the exclamation and as he dies, he behaves haughtily towards the criminal, whereupon his soul is taken by the devil. The criminal runs away, falls into a pit, and is taken into heaven by angels."
1951,756B,Robber Madej (previously The Devils Contract),"A boy who intends to become a priest has been sold to the devil by his parents before birth [M211, S211, S222S226, S240]. When the boy becomes aware of this contract he first asks a priest, then a bishop, and finally the pope for advice. The boy wants to go to hell in order to dissolve the contract [F81.2], and the pope sends him to a hermit [N843]. The hermit directs him to his brother, a robber. The robber takes him to hell [H1235]. In hell the boy obtains his contract [H1273.1] (after many efforts to persuade the devil) and sees the fiery bed (chair) prepared for the robber [F771.1.9, J172, Q561]. In anticipating his punishments the robber decides (is told) to do penance [Q520.2] until his dry staff puts forth fresh blooms and fruit [Q521.1.1, Q521.1.2]. Assured of forgiveness, he dies happy and goes to heaven [Q172.3] (cf. Type 756C). The hermit is astonished but reconciles himself to Gods judgment (blasphemes God and is damned [Q312.3]). The boy returns from hell and becomes a priest. Cf. Types 756A, 756C."
1952,756C,The Two Sinners (previously The Greater Sinner),"A robber seeks to do penance [Q520.1] for murdering ninety-nine men or for murdering his parents [Q211.1] (for shooting at a consecrated wafer [C55.2, Q222.1]). After being rejected by several confessors [V29.1] he is assigned the following penance by an old man: to plant a firebrand (live coals, small twig, axe, garden) and to wait until it grows into a green tree [Q521.1.1]; to water the firebrand with water brought from a distance in his mouth [Q521.1.2]; to carry a bag of stones (one for each murder) on his back or an iron hoop on his head till it falls off [Q521.2, Q521.3]; to pasture black sheep till they become white [Q521.4]. Furthermore he should behave mercifully, carry a traveler over a stream, and offer free hospitality to all [Q523.5]. For many years the robber does penance in vain until he intercepts a man who is about to commit a great crime. The robber kills the man and then regrets the deed. Thereupon the firebrand blooms (the stones or the hoop fall off or the sheep turn white). His confessor tells him that all his sins have been forgiven because of the crime that was prevented by his last murder (because God is pleased with the hundredth murder) [Q545]. Cf. Types 756A, 756B."
1953,756C*,Receipt from Hell,A tenant goes to hell (with the help of a little man) in order to procure a receipt for the rent from his dead landlord. He brings it back (and receives a mark as sign of contact with the dead).
1954,756D*,Who Is the More Devout (previously More Devout,) A hermit (St. Peter) asks Christ if anyone is more devout than he. He is directed to a widow who hides in her house and takes care of the murderer of her only son (to a butcher who shelters the murderer of his father) [W15].
1955,756E*,Charity Rewarded,"Charity is rated higher than prayer or attendance at mass [V410.1]. Friends make a pilgrimage to Christs grave, and another friend stays at home (on the way, in the shop). When he sees a poor man carrying a dead sheep (hen) in order to feed his children, he gives him money (and goods). When the pilgrims return they say that they have also seen their friend who had stayed behind at the grave (their friends name on the table in church). So they realize that the soul of a person who does good goes to Christs grave. Cf. Type 759A."
1956,756G*,Faith Moves Mountains [D1766,"1, D2136.3.1]. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A sultan orders that all Christians in his domain be put to death unless they can, by the strength of their belief, move a certain mountain. A poor (one-eyed, blind) shoemaker accomplishes the miracle: the power of his words pushes the mountain into the sea (along with the sultan and his courtiers). Thus the Christians are freed from their imprisonment. (2) A bishop imprisoned by heathens must demonstrate the power of his belief by moving a mountain. While he hesitates, a youth in his service accomplishes the miracle by the strength of his belief. The witnesses are so impressed that they convert to Christianity. (3) A Catholic craftsman uses his hammer to strike a mountain, which is moved into the sea."
1957,757,The Emperors Haughtiness Punished (previously The Kings Haughtiness Punished),"(Jovinian, Roderigo). The emperor Jovinian feels like God. When he bathes, a stranger (angel) who looks like him takes away his clothes and reigns in his place [L411]. When Jovinian returns naked to the court nobody recognizes him and he is driven away. In his despair he starts to regret his former haughtiness. Later, when he asks again for the sovereignty, he is accepted as emperor. The stranger who had ruled in his place discloses himself as his guardian angel and disappears. From then on the emperor lives humbly in a godfearing manner."
1958,758,The Various Children of Eve,"After the expulsion from paradise Eve gives birth to a child every year. Her children are all different: some beautiful, some ugly. When God pays her a visit Eve bathes her beautiful children and dresses them nicely. She hides the ugly ones. (She is ashamed of the number of her children and therefore hides some.) When God arrives he blesses the beautiful children and destines them to become kings, earls, citizens or traders. Thereupon Eve wants her ugly children (hidden in the straw, hay, oven) to be blessed as well. God destines those to be farmers, fishermen, smiths, tanners, shoemakers and servants. Upon Eves protest God explains that every class is necessary and legitimate for the functioning of society. Sometimes Eve consents to Gods will [A1650.1]. Cf. Type 1416."
1959,759,Angel and Hermit (previously Gods Justice Vindicated) [J225,"0.1]. A saint (Moses, Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi, St. Peter, hermit) doubts Gods justice and blames him for sending suffering to virtuous people and well-being to bad ones. Or, a saint asks God for the reason for his decisions, an angel asks a saint (hermit) to accompany him to see Gods secret decisions, or, an angel and a hermit meet and decide to travel together. The angel (Gods messenger) forbids his companion to speak or to ask questions [C410, C411.1, C423.2, C491]. On their way the angel does many seemingly unjust and cruel things: he kills the child and/or the servant of a hospitable host and a man he meets in the street [J225.4, J225.5]; he repays hospitality by stealing a cup [J225.3], inhospitality by giving a cup (present); he repays an inhospitable person by constructing a house (rebuilding a fallen wall); he destroys the house (harvest) of hospitable people; he damages (sinks) a ship because of one sinner on board [J225.0.2, U21.3]; he kills the only cow of a poor woman; he offers good wishes to inhospitable people, and bad wishes to hospitable ones. Later the angel explains why each of these strange deeds was just. When the hermit sees the justification for each deed, he agrees that none of Gods acts should be blamed or doubted. Gods deeds are always justified. Cf. Types 759*, 840."
1960,759*,The Hospitable Widows Cow Killed,"A poor widow (man) hospitably receives God and St. Peter for the night [K1811]. The next day, when God orders a wolf to kill the widows only cow, St. Peter rebukes God for ingratitude. God replies, She has no need of the cow, for tonight she will be with me. Or, when the widow suffers her loss without reproach, God rewards her generously. Cf. Types 750B, 759."
1961,759A,The Sinful Priest,"A man refuses to receive holy communion from an unworthy priest [V31.1]. God sends him a dream of unbearable thirst. He finds a well where a leper draws water for many people to drink. When he also wants to drink from it, the leper draws back his hand and says, Why do you want to take water from a lepers hand but you refuse to receive the sacrament from an unworthy priest It is reprehensible to say that the power of the sacrament depends on the virtue of the man who gives it [J157.1, V39.3]. Cf. Type 756E*."
1962,759B,Holy Man Has his own Mass,"A man never comes to mass. When upbraided for not coming, he hangs his coat on a sunbeam. The priest realizes that he is a pious man and that even though he stays at home, he is nearer to God than the priest himself (other people) [Cf. F1011.1, V29.3, V43]."
1963,759C,The Widows Flour,"A poor woman shares her small property with beggars but loses her last flour (bread) in a storm. When some traders arrive safely in spite of a leak (calm) she complains to the king (Solomon) about the injustice of the wind. In thanks for their rescue, the traders deliver a certain amount (of money) to the king to be given to the poor. At first they do not know where the leak is, but then they discover that a flour sack plugged the hole. The poor woman identifies the sack as the one she had lost, and the king gives her the money as compensation. (The god of the winds has to pay for the compensation) [J355.1]."
1964,759D,The Punishment of the Angel,"(Including the previous Type 795.) An angel (the death) is sent by God to take the soul of a widow with two children [E722.2.10]. He does not fulfill the task [A106.2, E754.2.2.1, V233.1]. Thereupon God, in order to show that he cares even for the smallest creatures, tells the angel to fetch a stone out of the sea where a small worm is hidden [D1810.0.1]. The angel is punished by becoming deaf, blind or senseless, or he is driven out of the sky. He has to do penance for his sin on earth [A106.2.1] by pretending to be human and by serving a man (abbot, hermit, custodian, farmer) [A1549.4] on earth. As a servant he works for his master [D1811.2] but he acts in a ridiculous and strange way, smiling mysteriously [N456, M304]. He mocks a man who buys shoes that will last a long time, because the man will die soon. He throws stones at a church (wedding procession) because he sees the devil there. He favours a pub because the people inside pray and ask for Gods mercy. At the burial of a dignitary he behaves disrespectfully, while at the burial of a poor man he renders his reverence [J225.8, J225.0.1.1]. He mocks holy things and scorns a crucifix (holy statue, shrine). He contradicts a judgment, saying it is wrong. He insults a beggar for being in reality a rich man. When he meets an emperor and his brother, a bishop, he smiles because he recognizes them as the two pitiful children who were the reason why he had been punished, and who had both achieved high positions. By this the angel finally learns something about divine justice."
1965,759E,The Miller of Sans Souci,"A rulers new palace is built where there is already a building (house, mill) that belongs to one of his subjects (old woman, miller). Because this subject objects to losing his home, rather than demolishing the small building, the ruler permits it to be incorporated into the new palace [P411.1]."
1966,760,The Unquiet Grave,"A man burns his three pregnant fiances (wife, wives). After the mans death his corpse reappears (again and again) in the church [E411.1, Q211.3]. Guests come to the parsonage to see the corpse. The clergymans maidservant is paid to take the dead man and return him to his grave [E411.0.2]. But the corpse holds her fast and asks her to beg his murdered fiances pardon when they come to the church. They agree only after the third time, whereupon the corpse returns to the grave and finds rest. In some variants a boy who mocks the church (clergyman, Virgin Mary) is condemned and sinks to earth as a stone. Later the stone is found and carried into a room where it laughs and tells its story. A special word cancels the curse and the corpse in the form of the stone changes to dust."
1967,760**,The Obstinate Child,"An obstinate child (son) is disobedient and hits (mistreats) his mother. He becomes ill and dies. After he is buried, his hand keeps reaching out of the grave and will not decompose [E411.0.1]. The authorities advise his mother to strike the hand with a stick until it is bloody. It then goes back into the grave and the child is able to rest in peace."
1968,760***,Salvation in the Cradle,"The soul of a dead man is unable to rest (is tormented in purgatory). It explains to a passer-by (someone who wants to help) that its salvation is governed by the growth of a certain tree. The first child who lies in a cradle (coffin) made from the wood of this tree will be the one who lays the soul to rest [D791.1.3]. In some variants, the child must become a priest. When he serves his first mass, the restless soul will be able to rest."
1969,760A,The Forgiven Skeleton,"(Including the previous Type 882B*.) A man kills his wife (bride), dies (is executed), and comes back to haunt the living. The dead mans body (skeleton, skull, bone, hand, etc.) is removed (because of a wager) from the cemetery. The dead man is willing to be taken back to his grave only by the person (brave girl) who had taken him out of it. (The skeleton clings to the girl until they reach home, where it explains that it could not find peace because in its lifetime it had slandered an illegitimate child. It asks the girl to beg the mothers pardon.) Once it has been forgiven the skeleton disintegrates to ashes and finds peace (deliverance)."
1970,760A*,The Death of a Miser,"A miser swallows his money before he dies. The devil (his sons, his servant) shakes the money out of him and carries off his body (to hell) [Q272.3]."
1971,761,The Cruel Rich Man as the Devils Horse,"A farmer is helped in a conflict with his hard-hearted landlord. His magic helper performs all tasks (gives him a horse that performs all tasks for him). Finally the man learns that the horse is an ancestor of the landlord [Q584.2] and that it comes from hell (devil). When he tells his landlord what has happened, he is friendly from then on for fear of being transformed as well."
1972,762,Woman with Three Hundred and Sixty-five Children,"A childless noblewoman accuses a poor mother of twins (triplets) of adultery [T587.1], whereupon the woman curses her to bear as many children as there are days (months) in a year [T586.1]. In the absence of her husband she gives birth to seven (nine, twelve, thirteen, or more) children (sons) [T586.1]. Being ashamed she orders her servant to drown all except one. The servant meets the father on his return and pretends to be carrying puppies in the basket. The father secretly educates the children and finally presents them to his wife and some guests. Guests and sons pray for mercy for the mother. From this time children of multiple birth have been called Guelfs (Dogs, Trazegnies, Porcelets, etc.) [L435.2.1]. Cf. Types 755, 765."
1973,763,The Treasure Finders who Murder One Another,"Three (two, more) men (hunters, friends, brothers) find (rob) a treasure. When one of them goes to town to fetch some food, the others plan to murder one another in order not to share the treasure. Those who stayed kill (stab to death, drown) the one who left when he returns, but they die later from eating bread (wine) which he had poisoned [K1685]. In some variants Christ travels with some of his followers. When they find a treasure he tells them not to touch it but to continue their way. Later two of them return secretly to take the treasure and they murder one another. Or, two men find the treasure and murder one another. When Christ and his followers find them dead, Christ explains that this was the reason why he told them not to take the treasure."
1974,765,The Mother who Wants to Kill her Children [S12],"(Including the previous Type 765A*.) A woman tries to kill her (illegitimate) children (twins, her third, her twelfth child, etc.) (by hiding them). The father rescues the children and keeps them hidden [R153.2.1]. After many years they emerge. The mother dies of fright (is executed) [Q211.8]. Cf. Types 755, 762."
1975,766,The Seven Sleepers,"This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with persons who are cast into in a magic sleep extending over many years [D1960.1]. Twelve children are cast into a three hundred years sleep by an angel (only the eldest child St. Peter is mentioned by name). They go back in time, and they awake on the night when Jesus is born. From then on they follow him as his twelve apostles."
1976,767,Food for the Crucifix,"A pious (simple) boy offers bread to a statue (crucifix, image of Christ or the Virgin Mary). As his reward he is entertained in heaven [Q172.1]."
1977,768,St,"Christopher and the Christ Child. The giant Reprobus (Christopher) wants to serve only the mightiest master. First he serves the king, but leaves because the king fears the devil. The giant serves the devil, but he leaves him when he refuses to pass a crossroads. A hermit (ferryman) tells the giant to carry a child across the river. The child becomes heavier with each step and finally explains the reason: that he is Christ who carries the sins of the world. The giant is doubtful, but then his staff changes into a blossoming plum (fig) tree. Thus he is convinced and from then on he bears the name Christophorus the man who carried Christ [Q25]."
1978,769,"The Childs Grave (previously Dead Childs Friendly Return to Parents) [E324, E361]",This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A mother discovers her dead child in a procession of dead children. It is forced to carry a heavy jug and tells its mother to stop weeping because it has to collect all her tears in the jug. From then on the mother stops weeping. (2) A dead child returns to tell its mother to stop weeping. Its shroud is so wet from her tears that the child cannot find rest in the grave. From then on the mother bears her pain without weeping and her child stays quiet in the grave.
1979,770,The Nun who Saw the World,A nun (named Beatrice) breaks her vow and leaves the convent (out of love or passion). During her absence the Virgin Mary takes her place in the community [K1841.1]. When the nun returns to the convent the miracle becomes evident.
1980,770A*,Guardian Angel,"This miscellaneous type includes different tales dealing with people who are protected by an invisible being (angel) from danger, injury, or acting badly [V238]. Examples: (1) A priest offends the new (second) wife of a prince. The prince wants to take revenge. He summons the priest, intending to shoot him. When the priest arrives, the prince instead invites him to dinner. The courtiers ask the prince why he suddenly changed his mind. He says that someone standing next to him told him what to do. No one else saw such a person, so the prince thinks it must have been an angel. (2) A girl going through a forest is followed by a man who tries to rape her. She falls to her knees and prays to God, and the man lets her go. A few days later he attacks another girl and is arrested. He is asked why he let the first girl go, and replies that someone was with her. (3) A clergyman who is disliked by his congregation is called to go to the house of someone who is dying. When he arrives he finds no one there. He thinks he was the victim of a prank and goes home. Years later when he goes again to a deathbed, he learns that the false summons had been made by someone who intended to kill him. But the villain saw that the clergyman was accompanied by someone else (angel, man dressed in white) and gave up his plan."
1981,772,Wood for the Holy Cross,"This miscellaneous type comprises various legends dealing with the wood used for the Holy Cross (wood from a tree in Paradise used for Jesus Crucifixion; the Holy Cross rediscovered by St. Helena and recovered by the Emperor Heraclius) [A2221.2.2, A2721.2.1, Z352]. Examples: Adams son Seth wants to bring oil from the tree of mercy to his dying father. An angel gives him instead a branch (seed) from the Tree of Life (Tree of Knowledge), which Seth plants on Adams grave. Later, Solomon has this tree cut down to use in his temple. The beam does not fit so it is used as a bridge and subsequently buried. It is discovered just in time to be used to make the cross for the Crucifixion. Cf. Type 772*."
1982,772*,The Flies Instead of Nails on Christs Heart,"Flies look like nails and prevent more nails being driven in [A2221.2.1, B483]. Cf. Type 772."
1983,773,Contest of Creation between God and the Devil,"This miscellaneous type comprises different tales dealing with the theme, God and the devil as creators. [A1750ff., A2286.2ff.]. They have a strong dualistic tendency. Examples: (1) The creation of contrasting animals. The devil makes creatures in competition with God (often copies the creatures God made) [A1751]. (2) The devil tries to create humans but fails, and instead he creates certain animals [A1755, A1811, A1833.1, A1862, A1893]. For example, God makes Adam out of clay and the devil tries to copy him. He shapes the clay and blows life into it, but it turns into a monkey. In other variants, the devil makes inferior races of humans. (3) The good principle competes with the bad one, as God and the devil create various animals. God creates a wolf which is called Gods dog, and the destructive devil deliberately creates goats [A63.4]. The devils animals devour Gods animals [A2286.2.1]. (4) The devils animals are brought to life by God [A1217]. The devil shapes some animals but only God (the name of God) can bring them to life. When the devil refuses to utter Gods name, the animals remain lifeless [A1756]. (5) God takes the devils animals. The devil creates (owns) animals that God wants for himself.

1986,774A,St,"Peter Wants to Create a Man (replaces the head of an innocent, beheaded person). He puts the head on backwards [E34, E783.1]. St. Peter consoles himself with the idea that the resuscitated person could become a rope-maker who has to walk backwards while working. In some variants Christ asks St. Peter to settle a dispute between a woman and the devil. Thoughtlessly he cuts off the heads of both. When he puts the heads back, he exchanges them. Since that time it is said that women have had the devil inside their bodies. Cf. Type 1169."
1987,774B,St,Peter Cannot Sell his Donkey because he points out all its defects.
1988,774C,The Legend of the Horseshoe,"Christ and St. Peter find a horseshoe. St. Peter is unwilling to lean over to pick it up. Christ picks it up, sells it and buys cherries with the proceeds.

He shares only one (bad) cake with Christ and hides the other (good) one under his cap where it burns all his hair off [cf. A1315.2]. Cf. Types 751G*, 774L. In some variants St. Peter becomes so tousled during a fight in a pub that he loses all his hair."
1994,774K,St,"Peter Stung by Bees. St. Peter becomes angry at Christ for destroying the harvest of all the farmers because of only one sinner. But he himself drowns a whole hive because of one bee sting. When Christ points to the parallel, St. Peter is subdued [J225.0.2].

When he is asked to produce it, he replies that the candle would become smaller by itself, or he discharges his promise by offering a small light, or does not fulfill the promise at all [K231.3, K231.3.1]. Cf. Type 1718*. Version from the Middle Ages: A farmer leading a cow and a calf to St. Michael fears the sea and calls on the saint for help, promising to sacrifice the calf. When free from danger, he says that St. Michael was foolish to expect him to give the calf. Again the sea rises, again the farmer calls for help, and St. Michael appears.

They dance themselves into the earth, hollowing out a hole, and finally die. After their death, as many stones as there were dancers were set up as a memorial."
2005,779F*,Mass of the Dead,"This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A woman (man) who thinks she has overslept for an early church service (during Advent, on Christmas or New Years) hurries to church. She finds it brightly lit and filled with unfamiliar worshipers it is the Mass of the Dead. A dead acquaintance (neighbor) tells her to leave. Terrified, she runs away, but leaves a piece of clothing behind. She goes back but cannot retrieve it because the church door will not open.

Someone who goes hunting instead of to church suffers an accident (dies). Someone who plays bowls on Sunday is killed by a ball. A choirboy who plays cards behind the organ is caught by the devil. People who play cards or dance on Christmas instead of going to church sink into the earth along with the house in which they met [C94.1.1] (cf. Type 779E*)."
2009,560,The Magic Ring,"A boy buys a dog, a cat, and a snake in order to save them from death (he rescues a snake from burning). In return he receives a magic ring (stone) from the king of the snakes (father of the rescued snake) which will grant all wishes [D810, D812, D1470.1, D1470.1.15, D817.1, B360, B505, B421, B422] (he finds the ring [D840]). With his wishing ring [D1662.1] he builds a magic castle [D1131.1] and performs impossible tasks (building a castle, a bridge of glass, a church of wax, etc. in one night). He marries the princess, who has a lover. The wishing ring is stolen from him by the princess [D861.5, K2213] (by her lover [D861.4], another person) who wishes herself and the castle (with the princess) to be transported to a faraway island [D2136.2]. Her husband finds himself poor again. The grateful dog and cat swim to the castle and recover the ring [D882, B548.1, D882.1.1] with the help of a mouse [K431]. On their way back they lose the ring in the sea, but a fish (crayfish) gives it back to them. Finally the boy recovers his ring, the castle and his wife. He punishes the lover (his faithless wife). Cf. Types 561, 562."
2010,561,Aladdin,"A magician orders a (stupid) boy, Aladdin, to fetch a lamp for him out of a cave of treasures. The cave opens and closes by means of a magic ring [D1470.1.5]. Aladdin finds the lamp [D812.5, D840, D1470.1.16, D1421.1.5, D1662.2], but when he wants to leave the cave it does not open (the magician has closed it). When Aladdin rubs the magic ring (lamp) in despair, a helpful genie appears and leads him out. Aladdin reaches his mothers house and wishes for riches and a castle [D1131.1]. Both wishes are fulfilled by the genie (by another spirit who appears in the same way when the lamp or the ring is rubbed). Aladdin woos the princess, but her father intends to marry her to another man (Aladdin marries the princess [L161]). The magician exchanges the old, magic lamp (which the princess had kept) for a new, worthless one [D860, D371.1]. He wishes himself to be transfered to Africa together with the princess and the castle [D2136.2]. Aladdin is imprisoned. He rubs the ring [D881] and the genie takes him to the castle where the princess is. She poisons the magician (Aladdin kills him). Aladdin takes the lamp again and uses it to return with the castle and the princess to his home. Cf. Types 560, 562."

He keeps it for himself (kills the old woman). He discovers that when he lights the fire-steel a helpful spirit (dogs, iron man, giant) appears [D1470.1, D1421.1.2, D1421.1.4, N813]. He orders the spirit to bring the princess to him during three successive nights [D1426]. She has to serve him (he kisses her, impregnates her). The king tries to discover where his daughter goes by putting a mark on the door [R135]. The spirit discovers the ruse and defeats it by putting the same mark on all the houses. The third time the soldier takes the princess, he is discovered (gives up himself) and imprisoned. He asks for his fire-steel, and before he is executed he asks for permission to smoke for one last time. When he lights his fire-steel, the spirit appears and rescues him (and imprisons the king instead) [K331, D1391]. By threatening violence the soldier forces the king to agree that he may marry his daughter. Cf. Types 560, 561.

On his way home he stays in an inn and others see him use the table (he forbids others to use it) [J2355.1]. The innkeeper cheats him by exchanging the magic table (cloth) with an ordinary one [D861.1, K2241, D861.3, D861.2]. After the poor man arrives home the table does not have any magic power, so he goes back to the giver and complaints. The giver gives him a gold-dropping animal (donkey [B103.1.1], hen, etc.). The same thing happens again. This time the man receives a sack containing a magic cudgel [D1401.2] (mannikin) that beats people until it is called off by its owner [D1601.5, D1401.1, D1651.2]. The man himself is beaten by the cudgel. When the greedy innkeeper tries to steal the sack, the cudgel beats him until he returns all the stolen magic objects [D881.2]. Cf. Types 564, 565, and 569."
2013,564,"The Magic Providing Purse (previously The Magic Providing Purse and Out, Boy, out of the Sack!)","A supernatural being (devil, spirits, fortune, frost, wind) gives a poor man an object (knapsack, sack, purse, pot, box) that supplies him with unlimited food. The man takes it home to his family. A rich man (brother, neighbor) buys (borrows, steals) the magic object, and soon the poor man is hungry again. He asks the supernatural being for a replacement and receives a similar looking object. But this one produces men with cudgels (whips) instead of food; they beat him and his family. The poor man gives the object to his rich neighbor. He is beaten until he returns the food-supplying object to the poor man. In some variants the last scene occurs at a meal organized by the rich man and all his guests are beaten. Cf. Types 563, 565."
2014,565,The Magic Mill,"A poor man receives a ham from his rich brother (the devil) who tells him to go to the devil with it. An old man directs him to the devil, where he exchanges his ham for a mill that grinds anything its owner wishes (meal, salt [D1601.21.1], other food; a pot that fills itself with porridge [D1601.10.1, D1472.1.9]). Only its owner can command it to stop [D1651, D1651.3]. The poor man becomes rich. Cf. Type 480C*. His envious brother buys (steals) the mill, but he does not know how to stop it. It grinds such a quantity of food (flour, herrings, porridge, etc.) that the man is overpowered (it fills the whole house with porridge [C916.3]). The real owner stops it and takes it back again. Often combined with the following episode: A ship-captain steals (buys) the mill and commands it to grind salt. He also cannot stop it, and it grinds so much salt that his ship finally sinks. The mill keeps grinding at the bottom of the sea, and this is why sea-water is salty [A1115.2]. Cf. Types 563, 564."
2015,566,The Three Magic Objects and the Wonderful Fruits,"(Fortunatus). (Including the previous Type 580*).

The king notices the glamorous life-style of the owner of the purse. By a ruse (by playing cards [D861.6]) the princess steals the purse (magic objects). Its owner gets the magic objects of his brothers, and they are stolen as well. He eats magic fruits (apple, fig, nut, vegetables, magic drink) that cause and cure disfigurement (horns grow on the head, and are removed). He gives (sells) the princess the magic fruits and horns grow on her head [D992.1, D1375.1] (she grows a long nose [D1376.1], is transformed into a donkey [cf. Type 567]). He sells her the healing fruits only when she confesses her theft and promises to return his magic objects [D881.1, D895, D1375.2]. Cf. Type 567."
2016,567,The Magic Bird-heart,"A man eats the heart of a magic bird and thereby receives the power of spitting gold [B113.1] (of finding a coin under his pillow every day, he becomes king [D1561.1.1, M312.3]). A woman (his own wife) causes him to vomit the bird-heart, eats it herself (because she learned its secret from an old woman) [D861.5] and casts him out. He finds a magic herb that transforms people into donkies [D965, D983, D551.2, D132.1, D661]. With the help of the herb he changes the woman to donkey (and makes it work hard). Cf. Type 566.

2017,567A,The Magic Bird-Heart and the Separated Brothers,"Two brothers condemned to death (whose stepmother claims they have insulted her [K2111, S322.4]) are spared [K512]. They eat parts of a magic bird (magic object, magic fruit, etc.) that will make one become a king, and the other produce gold (precious stones) when laughing (crying). (The magic bird is prepared as a meal for another person [by their mother] but the brothers eat it by mistake.) The brothers flee and are separated (when fetching water [N311]). The elder brother is chosen as king [N683] (with the help of a royal elephant [H171.1]). The younger brother is enslaved by a foreign king who forces him to produce gold (he falls into the hands of a shipowner who sacrifices him so that his becalmed ship may sail [S264.1]. He is cast overboard, arrives in a distant land, and wins a [several] brides). Finally the brothers are reunited and the younger brother is freed (the elder searches for his younger brother and finds him)."
2018,569,"The Knapsack, the Hat and the Horn","The youngest of three poor brothers obtains a magic object [D840, D1470.1] (table-cloth, napkin, table, mill) that magically produces food [D1472.1.22]. On his way he exchanges the object for a knapsack that can produce an army [D1475.4] (magic weapon, stick, sabre, cudgel out of the sack). By means of this he secures the first object again [D831]. In the same way he gets other magic objects that function as weapons (hat), make walls fall down (horn [D1222]), provide him with unlimited quantities of money, let him cover enormous distances (seven-league boots, flying carpet), produce a castle (etc.), or resuscitate the dead (violin, flute). Back home he lives a glamorous life. The magic objects are stolen from him by a cunning guest (king, princess, neighbor). By using the last object he recovers them all. With the help of the magic horn he destroys the attacking army and kills the king and his daughter; or, he resuscitates the people he has killed, makes piece with the king, marries the princess, and inherits (half of) the kingdom. In some variants the king is attacked by enemies. The boy rescues him from danger using his magic objects, and marries the princess. Cf. Type 465A."
2019,570,The Rabbit-herd,"A king offers his daughter in marriage to whoever can herd (catch, tame, train) his 100 (more or fewer) rabbits (roosters, sheep, goats, geese, partridges) without losing any [T68, H335, H1112]. The youngest of three brothers is kind to an old woman (to whom his brothers were unkind) and receives a magic whistle with which he can summon the rabbits [D1441.1.2]. In order to avoid the marriage, members (deputies) of the royal family (in disguise) try to buy one of his rabbits. The young man demands a degrading humiliating act (e.g. jumping on one leg, dancing to the whistle, turning somersaults, attaching a pot to his or her bottom, being beaten, cutting flesh out of his/her own body, branding his/her skin, tearing an animal carcass with teeth, kissing the backside of an animal [K1288] or of a person, sodomy, eating excrement, kissing him or sleeping with him [K1358]). After the demands are fulfilled, the young man whistles and the rabbit comes back to him. Not willing to admit defeat, the king sets another task: the young man should fill a sack of lies (truths) [H1045]. When the king realizes that the lies are actually truths that humiliate the royal family [K1271.1.1], he announces that the sack is filled up and agrees to the marriage."
2020,570*,The Rat-Catcher,"(The Pied Piper.) A city has been overrun by rats and mice. A man dressed in odd, colorful clothing promises the inhabitants that he will drive the vermin out in return for a fee. He lures the animals out by playing a flute and drowns them in a river.

She goes (with the fisherman, alone after he has been killed) to another country where she becomes wealthy (with the help of the vessel). She disguises herself as a man [K1837] and returns home. Her father wants to have the magic dish, and she says she will give it to him if he will sleep with her. He agrees. She reveals who she is and exposes his hypocrisy. They are reconciled."
2022,571,All Stick Together,"A melancholy princess is promised in marriage to whoever can make her laugh [F591, H341, H1194, T68]. The youngest (most stupid) of three brothers (poor shepherd, son of a farmer or craftsman) receives a magic object (golden animal, vehicle) [D817] from an old woman (man, supernatural being) because of his kindness (out of pity, through a lucky bargain). On his way (during an overnight stay) a curious person (thief) touches the object and cannot let it go (the young man makes the person stick to it by a magic formula or stick) [K422, D1413, D2171.3.1]. Later other (naked) people, objects, and animals become attached to the magic object or to each other [D2171.5].

In order to get rid of the husband he denounces him to the master (of the castle), pretending that the husband practices magic. The master thereupon orders him to perform (three) impossible tasks [H931, H1010], of which the last one is to make a Himphamp a fictional word without any meaning. The husband gets help (from the devil [D812.3], supernatural being) to solve the tasks, the last one by a magic formula that makes things stick together. He surprises the loving couple in bed and makes them stick together (to the chamber pot [D1413.8]). Or, a man learns that his wife has commited adultery. By means of a magic sticking formula (magician) he makes the loving couple (clergyman and his wife) stick naked to the chamber pot [D1413.8] (basin [D1413.7]) [K1217] (previously Type 571A). Helpful servants get also stuck. The next day the man leads the chain of persons through the streets. Other people (farmhand, maidservant), animals (cow, bull) and objects (food) get stuck in obcene situations and are mocked by passers-by. The man presents his Himphamp to the master.

He becomes her lover, and impregnates her (is taken in the very act). When the king learns what has happened, he orders the prince (and his daughter) to be executed. The lovers escape by riding together on the flying object to the princes home country [R111.3.1, R215.1], where they marry. In some variants they land on their way so the princess can give birth.

With their help he is able to perform the tasks [D1581, H971.1] (to fell a large oak in one day and in the same time to dig a well at his court, etc.) and win the princess."
2029,580,Beloved of Women,"At their fathers death three brothers are each granted a wish: the two elder ones wish for riches, but the youngest wishes for the power to make women love him [D1900]. They set out on a journey and spend the night in three different inns. The youngest brother sleeps with the wife (daughter) of the house and receives three magic objects [D856]: a tablecloth on which food magically appears, a rooster (similar) that produces drinks, and a pair of scissors that produces clothes out of nothing. The brothers reach a town where all who enter must be castrated. The youngest refuses and is taken as a prisoner to an island. With the help of his magic objects he secures a comfortable life for himself and the other prisoners. A princess (kings widow) wants to buy the objects. The boy is only willing to give them to her if he may spend the night in her chamber, beside her, and finally in her bed [T45]. At the end he marries her."
2030,585,"Spindle, Shuttle, and Needle","A prince will marry the girl who is at once the poorest and the richest [H1311.2]. Spindle, shuttle, and needle help a virtuous girl out of gratitude for her industry. The spindle guides the prince to her [D1425.1], the shuttle makes a magic road [D1484.1, D1485.1], and the needle transforms the poor room to a beautiful one [D1337.1.7]. The prince marries the girl."
2031,590,The Faithless Mother (previously The Prince and the Arm Bands),"A boy sets out on a journey with his mother. On their way he finds an object (armband, belt, sword, shirt, etc.) which gives him supernatural strength [D840, D1335.5, D1335.4]. In a house of robbers (giants, other supernatural beings) the son defeats all of them (cf. Type 650A) until only one is left with whom his mother (secretly) starts a liaison [S12.1] (she marries him). In order to get rid of the son (the lover fears the sons strength) the mother feigns sickness and sends her son on a dangerous quest for a remedy [H931, H1211, H1212] (fruit [apple] from the garden of supernatural beings [H1333.3.1, H1333.3.1.1, H1333.3.1.3, D1364.4.1], water of life, animals milk [H1361]) for which he must risk his life. The son returns successful and uninjured [F615, F615.2.1], accompanied by wild animals that have become his protectors [B315, B431.2, B520]. In numerous variants the boy rescues a young girl (princess [R111.1.1]) during one of his adventures and sends (brings) her back to her father, and/or he meets female helpers (old woman, a girl skilled in magic, his bride). The boys mother asks him for the secret of his strength and steals it (ties him, gives him a narcotic drink, persuades him to take a bath) [K975, D861]. Then she (and/or her lover) blinds (murders) the boy. When he is blinded he is found by the princess, who nurses and restores his sight by observing how a blind animal is healed [B512]. When he is murdered he is resuscitated by one of his female helpers (using the remedies he procured). He recovers the object that holds his strength [D880] and takes revenge on his mother and her lover (kills them). He marries the princess (female helper, daughter of the helper). Cf. Type 315."
2032,591,The Thieving Pot,"A poor man (farmer, orphan boy) receives (in exchange for his cow) a magic pot [N421, D851] which goes to his neighbors where it fills itself with food, money, etc. Then the pot takes its contents back to its owner [D1605.1]. When the person whom it robbed tries to catch the pot, it takes him to its poor owner where it has to be redeemed (the theft has to be forgiven). Or, the pot takes the man to hell [D1412.2]."
2033,592,The Dance Among Thorns,"A poor boy, driven from home by his evil stepmother [S322.4] (dismissed from service with a pittance [W154.1]), gives all his money as alms to a beggar (supernatural being) [Q42.1] who in return grants the boy three wishes [D1761.0.2]: a never failing gun [D1653.1.7] (crossbow [D1653.1.4]), a fiddle (flute) that compels people to dance [D1415.2.5], another magic object or the magic power of having his wishes obeyed [D1761.0.1]. He shoots a bird (on a wager [N55, N55.1]), which falls into a thornbush. When a monk (Jew, the loser of the wager) tries to take the bird out, the boys magic fiddle makes him dance in the thorns. The boy is condemned and led to the gallows. He asks for permission to play his fiddle for the last time. The judge and whole assembly have to dance until the boy is released [K551.3.1]."
2034,593,Fiddevav,"A poor boy intends to marry a young woman but her father (she herself) refuses. The rejected suitor receives from a person skilled in magic (old woman [N825.3], witch, priest, devil) a magic stone, which, when put into ashes, makes all people who use it (farmer, farmwife, farmhand, maidservant, preacher, daughter, etc.) stick to the poker and compells them to keep talking nonsense (e.g. Fiddevav) [D1413, D1413.17, D2172.1], (or, a magic root under the doorstep causes them fart). Only the suitor is able to release the people from the charm by taking the magic object away. In return he marries the young woman. Cf. Types 330A, 571, 571B."
2035,594*,The Magic Bridle,"A boy, setting out, obtains a bridle that tames all kinds of horses [D1442.1], a needle that makes everything fall to pieces [D1562.4], and a gun that always hits what he aims at [D1653.1.7]. The boy works as a servant at the kings court. By means of his magic objects he performs great exploits and wins a princess as his wife."
2036,610,The Healing Fruits,"A sick princess is offered to whoever can cure her (with fruit) [T68.1, H346]. The youngest of three brothers succeeds [Q2, L10, L13]. He is kind to a little man (old woman, grateful animals), who gives him the healing fruit [N825.3, D1500.1.5], after his elder brothers had reacted with annoyance at the little mans questions. Before the marriage takes place, the king gives the youngest brother impossible tasks. The little man helps him again. He has to build a ship that moves faster on land than on water (cf. Type 513B), to herd 100 rabbits (cf. Type 570), and to fetch a feather from a magic bird (cf. Type 461). He performs the tasks, makes a fortune, returns, humbles the king, and marries the princess [L161]. Or, the king copies him in order to gain the same riches. On the way across a lake the ferryman drops him into the water and he is drowned. The young suitor gains his kingdom and marries the princess. Cf. Type 551."
2037,611,The Gifts of the Demons (previously The Gifts of the Dwarfs),"The son of a merchant is betrothed to the daughter of another merchant (the adoptive son of a merchant falls in love with the merchants daughter). When the boys father dies, the girls parents change their minds and send the boy to sea to get rid of him. The ship sinks but the boy saves himself (on an island). He rescues a child (from a lion, wolf, eagle, dragon, bad man) and receives a magic remedy (magic salve [D1500.1.19], healing water) as reward [D817.1] from demoniac women (dwarfs [F451.5.1], trolls, giants) with which he heals a sick princess (king), and a magic sword (spectacles, binoculars, flute, whistle, bone, gun) with which he overcomes a hostile army [D1400.1.4.1]. He returns home a rich man and marries the bride who had been promised to him in childhood (his first love [T102])."
2038,612,The Three Snake-Leaves,"(Including the previous Types 465A* and 612A). A man promises his wife (bride) that if she dies before him he will be buried with her [M254, S123.2] (to keep watch at her grave). She soon (after the wedding) dies. In the grave (at the grave-side) he sees a snake (weasel) revive another dead snake with a herb (three leaves, blade of grass) [B512, B491.1, D1500.1.4]. He revives his wife in the same manner [E165]. His wife then falls in love with another man (ships captain) [K2213.5] and, together with her new lover, she throws her husband into the sea [K2213.2, S142]. Or, she leaves her husband and by a ruse causes him to be condemned to death (as a thief). A faithful servant [P361] (friend, his mother) resuscitates him with the snake-leaves [E105]. The guilty pair is exposed and punished [Q261]. In some Indian variants, a god permits a man to resuscitate his wife by giving her half of his own lifespan. She falls in love with another man and tries to kill her husband. He is rescued and asks his wife to return the given years he gave her. She dies for a second time. (Previously Type 612A.)"
2039,613,The Two Travelers,"(Truth and Falsehood). (Including the previous Types 613*, 613A*, and 613B*). Two men (travelers, brothers, tailor and cobbler) argue (wager) [N61] about whether truth or falsehood (justice or unjustice, whose religion) is more powerful. They call on animals and people they meet to act as judges [K451.1, N92]. The loser (the one who stands for the truth) is robbed and blinded, or the wicked man shares his bread with his hungry companion only if he will let his eyes be put out [M225, N2.3.3, S165]. The blind man spends the night in (under) a tree [F1045], where he overhears secrets of birds (other animals, devils, ogres, witches) [B253, G661.1, N451.1, N452]. By means of this knowledge [H963] he is able to restore his sight [D1505.5], to cure sickness (of the princess, king) [C940.1, D2064.1, V34.2], to end drought [F933.2, H1193, N452.1], etc. [N552.1.1, D2101, H1181]. He is rewarded (marries the princess [H346]). His companion, intending to acquire the same wealth, imitates him. He goes to the same tree (sometimes also blinded), but the birds (devils) think it was he who betrayed their secrets, and tear him to pieces [N471]."
2040,450,Little Brother and Little Sister,"Little brother and little sister run away from their home because of their cruel stepmother [S31.5, S31] or because their parents want to eat them. In spite his sisters warning, the brother drinks from a spring or an animals track [D555] and is transformed into a deer [D114.1.1] (lamb [D135], goat). The children live together in the forest until a prince finds them [P253.2, N711.1]. The sister hides up in a tree but the prince tricks her into coming down. She marries the prince and they take the animal brother with them. The prince is absent when their child is born. The sister is replaced by another bride [K1911, K1911.1.2], often the daughter of a bad woman (stepmother, witch, maid). The sister is thrown into the water [S142], transformed into a bird [D150] (fish [D170]), or swallowed by a fish [K1911.2.2.1]. She returns at night to suckle her child [E323.1.1, D688] and to look after her brother. A servant overhears the conversation between the animal brother and the sister and informs the prince [H13]. The false bride and her mother are punished. Cf. Type 403. In some variants the false bride and her mother want to kill the animal brother because they fear that the truth will be discovered. The cook saves him."
2041,451,The Maiden Who Seeks her Brothers,"(Including the previous Types 451A and 451*.) A girl rescues her twelve (seven, three, six) brothers [P253.0.5, P251.6.7, Z71.5.1] who had been transformed into animals (birds) [P253.2]. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms but they are often mixed with each other: (1) A stepmother transforms her stepsons into swans [D161.1] (ravens [D151.5]). The sister looks for her brothers and finds out how to release them: She has to be silent for some years [D758] and has to make shirts out of cotton-grass for the brothers [D753.1]. A king finds the young woman in the forest and marries her [N711]. In his absence she bears a child, but her mother-in-law takes it away and accuses her of eating the child [K2116.1.1] (having borne an animal). The young queen remains silent because of her brothers, even though she is to be executed. On her way to the funeral pyre her period of silence ends and her brothers are disenchanted. Everything is explained and the mother-in-law is punished. In some variants the disenchantment of one brother is not complete (he keeps a wing) because the sister cried a tear when her child was taken away (did not completely finish his shirt). (2) A girl finds her brothers in a remote place and keeps house for them. They tell her to take care of the cat (dog), watch the fire, and be careful of the demonic neighbor (ogre, witch). Once she forgets to divide her food with the cat, so it puts out the fire. After the girl asks the neighbor for help, the ogre comes regularly to suck her blood. When the brothers discover this, they kill him. The girl takes flowers (herbs) from the grave of the ogre. Her brothers eat them and they are changed into oxen (sheep, birds). The episode of disenchantment is less important. (3) A mother (father) curses her sons because there is not enough to eat. They are transformed into ravens (swans). The sister seeks for them and asks for directions from the sun, moon, and stars [H1232]. She finds her brothers on a glass mountain (glass palace). To reach them she needs a little bone as a key (gets help from the wind). She releases her brothers and they go back home. In some variants the episode with marriage and slander follows. Some variants start with the promise of the mother to sacrifice the brothers if a daughter (one more brother) is born [S272]. She tries to inform the boys after the birth by a sign [T595], but the wrong sign is sent [N344.1], so the brothers leave home [S272.1]."
2042,452B*,The Sisters as Oxen,"A witch and her daughter are jealous of three beautiful orphan girls who are in the kings favor. The witch puts magic powder in the girls soup and the two elder girls eat it and are transformed into oxen. The king asks the youngest girl to marry him and she accepts on condition that the oxen are cared for in the kings palace. The witch visits the palace and sticks two pins in the queens head, so she becomes a dove. The witchs daughter pretends to be the queen. The dove comes to the palace and is caught by a gardener, who has heard it speak. The king removes the pins from its head and it regains human form. The witch and her daughter are burned to death. Cf. Type 408."
2043,459,The Make-Believe Son (Daughter),A king casts out his first wife because she is childless. Later a maidservant informs the king that this queen has born a son (daughter) but the king is not allowed to see it. The queen is supplied with a house and food. After some years the king arranges a marriage for his child. The maidservant makes an image of a youth or puts an animal in a sedan-chair. A god pities the queen and vivifies the image or turns the animal into a handsome youth (young woman). The king is reconciled with the queen. In some variants a prince falls in love with a doll thinking it is a young woman and he wants to marry her. Her parents convince him to marry the daughter of their neighbor.
2044,425,The Search for the Lost Husband,"This type refers to a cycle of related tales. It combines episodes from types 425A425E, 425M, and 425*. Cf. Types 400, 430, 432, and 441."
2045,425*,The Insulted Bridegroom Disenchanted (previously Enchanted Animal Husband Insulted by Guests),"A princess (the youngest of three sisters) wants to marry. Her father insists that she must marry the first one whom she meets (whoever picks up a certain rose). A mouse with a stinking tail (a poor man carrying water) comes by, and the princess marries him [T118]. During the wedding feast, when guests insult the mouse-bridegroom, the castle and all its inhabitants disappear, and the princess finds herself alone. She sets out on a quest for her lost husband [H1385.4]. Two hermits direct her to the underworld. There she finds the castle of the mouse-bridegroom. Through her love he is disenchanted and turns into a beautiful prince [D700]. In some variants the princess lives in poverty with her husband. She dreams of a splendid castle and of wealth. Two times the dream comes true, and she invites her relatives to the castle. When her poor husband appears, someone calls his name and the castle disappears. The third time, she instructs them not to call her husbands name. Thus he is disenchanted."
2046,425A,The Animal as Bridegroom,"(Including the previous Type 425G.) This type combines various introductory episodes with a common main part. Cf. Types 430, 432, and 441. Introductory episodes: (1) The youngest daughter asks her father (the king) to bring her a (musical) rose (lark, etc.)from his journey. He finds it in the garden of a beast, but in return has to promise his daughter (the first being he meets when he arrives at home) [L221, S228, S241] to the beast. The father tries in vain to send another girl instead of his daughter [S252]. Cf. Type 425C. (2) An animal-son (snake, crayfish, also pumpkin, etc.)is born (because of the hasty wish of his parents) [C758.1]. He demands a princess for his wife and performs difficult (impossible) tasks. The princess has to marry him [T111]. (3) A girl is intended (by fate) for an animal bridegroom or agrees to marry him [B620.1, L54.1]. (4) For other reasons a girl has an animal husband and lives together with him in his castle. He becomes a beautiful man by night [D621.1, B640.1]. Main part: When the young wife (often on the advice of her female relatives) burns the animal-skin of her bridegroom [C757.1] (looks at him during the night or burns him with candle wax [C32.1, C916.1], reveals his secret [C421], or otherwise prevents his disenchantment), he goes away [C932]. The young wife sets out for a long and difficult quest [H1385.4] (in iron shoes [Q502.2], etc.). On her way she is given directions and precious gifts by the sun, moon, wind, and stars [H1232] (helpful old people or animals [H1233.1.1, H1235]. She arrives (sometimes by climbing a glass mountain [H1114]) at her bridegrooms far-away residence. She finds that her husband has another (supernatural) bride. She takes service as maid [Q482.1] and trades her precious things (golden implements for spinning, jewels, magnificent clothes, etc.)for three nights by the side of her lost husband [D2006.1.1]. She wants to awaken his memory of her, but two times he is drugged by a soporific. He spills the soporific on the third night, stays awake, and recognizes her as his true bride [D2006.1.4]. (Death of the false bride.) Cf. Type 313."
2047,425B,Son of the Witch (previously The Disenchanted Husband: the Witchs Tasks),"(Cupid and Psyche.) (Including the previous Types 425J, 425N, and 428.) This type combines various introductory episodes with a common main part. Cf. Type 425A. Introductory episodes: A young woman marries a supernatural bridegroom: (1) She is given to her bridegroom because of a present that she has asked her father to bring back from a journey [S228]. (2) The bridegroom performs a set of difficult tasks. (3) She pulls up an herb and discovers the bridegrooms subterranean castle (a wind carries her there). (4) She finds him in another way. The bridegroom is the son of a witch (ogress) or he is (during the day) an animal [D621.1]. Main part: The young woman breaks the bridegroom`s prohibition (cf. Typ 425A), and he goes away [C932]. (Before he leaves, he gives her a token, e.g. ring, feather.) (In iron shoes) she sets out to find him [H1385.4, H1125]. The bride comes to the house of her bridegrooms mother, a witch, who swears by her sons name not to devour her. The witch imposes difficult tasks on the young woman, which she performs (with the help of her bridegroom): to sort a large quantity of grain [H1122], to fill mattresses with the feathers of all kinds of birds, to wash the black wool white and the white black [H1023.6, cf. Type 1183], to sweep a house but leave it unswept [H1066], etc. In some variants she enchants (three) suitors and makes them fight (part of previous Type 425N). Cf. Types 313, 875. The young woman is sent on a dangerous journey to bring a casket from the sister of the witch. Having passed obstacles (with the advice from her bridegroom) and obtained the casket, she is forbidden to open it. (Cf. Types 408, 480.) When the bride acts against the prohibition, her husband helps her. At the wedding of the bridegroom and the witchs daughter, the young woman has to hold ten burning candles (torches). Her bridegroom saves her from being burned. The young woman remarries her bridegroom, or both escape by a magic (transformation) flight [D671, D672]. In some variants a female demon (witch) demands that a young woman accomplish impossible tasks [G204, H1010, H931]. Among other things, the girl has to bring a letter to another demon telling her to kill the girl [K978] (cf. Type 930). A wolf helps the girl to escape the danger [B435.3]. As a reward, the wolf is disenchanted. He turns to a prince [D113.1] and marries the young woman. (Previously Type 428.)"
2048,425C,Beauty and the Beast,"(Including the previous Type 425H.) A merchant sets out on a journey and intends to bring back presents for his three daughters. The two elder ones demand jewels and clothes, the youngest a rose [L221]. The father is not able to find one. He loses his way and stays overnight in a deserted castle, where he breaks off a rose. An (invisible) animal (beast) demands that the man return or send a substitute [S222]. The youngest daughter meets her fathers obligation but refuses to marry the (ugly) animal, who treats her kindly. In a magic mirror she sees her father is ill. She is allowed to visit him but (influenced by her envious sisters) overstays the allotted time [C761.2]. She returns and finds the animal near death, realizes she loves him, and caresses or kisses him. By this means she disenchants the prince from his animal shape [D735.1]. They marry."
2049,425D,The Vanished Husband (previously Vanished Husband Learned of by Keeping Inn (Bath-house),"(Including the previous Type 425F.) (A childless couple adopts an animal or object which grows up and wants to marry; cf. Type 433B). The animal (crayfish, frog, he-goat, bird, etc. , or the head of a donkey) performs the tasks set for the suitors [T68] and marries the kings youngest daughter. During the night he turns into a beautiful young man [B640.1]. He warns his wife against telling his secret, but she breaks the taboo and he leaves her [C932]. The wife sets up an inn (bakery, bathhouse) where everyone who tells a tale gets free service [H11.1.1] (disguised as a man [K1837], she gives a golden coin to everyone she meets, if they will tell a tale). She thus learns where her husband lives and how to save him [C991]. She finds her husband and disenchants him. In some variants a princess loses her enchanted bridegroom, a bird [D150], and becomes melancholy. The king promises a reward to anyone who can make the princess laugh [H1194]. An old woman, who knows where the bridegroom lives, tells the princess and makes her laugh. The princess finds her bridegroom in his castle. She releases him from his enchantment by starving for seven years (standing without shelter out in the wind and rain for a year or more). By doing this she becomes so ugly that the prince does not want her. With the help of kind fairies she becomes beautiful and wealthy. Her bridegroom falls in love with her. She makes demands on him (he must build a bridge and lie down in a coffin). They are reunited. (Previously Type 425F.)"
2050,425E,The Enchanted Husband Sings Lullaby,"(Including the previous Type 425L.) A young woman follows an enchanted man (usually a prince) to his underground castle (grotto) and marries him. During the night her husband takes on his human shape. He forbids her to open a certain room [C611] (she is not allowed to watch him at night, to wake him up, to open the padlock of his heart or to look through a keyhole into his body). She breaks the taboo and, although she is pregnant, she is chased away. The pregnant woman finds lodging in the house of a rich woman (queen) whose son had disappeared a long time ago. Here she gives birth to a child. At night the enchanted husband visits his sleeping wife, sings a lullaby to the child, and thus tells how he may be disenchanted (roosters must not crow, church bells must not ring, etc.). Maidservants report this to the lady of the house. In the third night the conditions demanded in the song are met (the enchanted man is embraced or seized). The man is released from the enchantment and is recognized as the missing son. (Previously Type 425L.) Cf. Type 434."
2051,425M,The Snake as Bridegroom (previously Bathing Girls Garments Kept),"A serpent (water being, dragon) steals the clothes of a bathing girl and gives them back only when she promises to marry him [K1335]. The serpent takes her as his bride to his splendid castle (at the bottom of the sea) where she gives birth to two children. The serpent promises that the woman may visit her parents if she performs certain impossible tasks (wearing out iron shoes [H1125, Q502.2], spinning an endless thread, etc.) [H1010]. By following the advice of an old woman she succeeds [N825.3], and finally she and her children are allowed to visit her parents for three days. But she is warned not to tell anyone about her husband [C421]. The woman keeps the promise. The children, however, tell the relatives about their father and give away the secret of the magic formula by which he can be summoned. The womans brothers call the serpent and kill him. Together with her children the woman returns. She calls her husband, but there is only blood in the sea. So she realises that the children have betrayed her and condemns them to be turned into trees [D215]."
2052,426,"The Two Girls, the Bear, and the Dwarf","During the winter two sisters (called Snow White and Rose Red) invite a bear into their hut. Three times the sisters rescue an evil dwarf who was going to steal some treasures, but he is ungrateful and insults them [F451.2.3.1, K1111.1, F451.6.1, F451.5.2.1]. Thereupon the bear (who had been enchanted by the dwarf) catches him. The dwarf offers treasures to the bear if he will devour the girls instead of him. But the bear kills the dwarf and thus is disenchanted and turns into a prince [D763]. The prince marries one of the sisters and his brother (who was not mentioned until then) the other."
2053,430,The Donkey (Asinarius),"After a royal couple have long wished for children, the queen finally gives birth to a donkey. Raised as a human, he learns courtly customs and how to sing and play the lyre (harp, etc.) [D963]. On the day when he first sees a reflection of his face, he runs away accompanied by a servant. In a foreign country he entertains the kings court with his musical talents. He meets the kings daughter and is charmed by her beauty. When the donkey wants to return home, the king tries to prevent him by offering him his daughter in marriage [B641.4]. On the wedding night the donkey takes off his skin and turns into a handsome prince. A servant who observes this tells the king, who burns up the skin on the following night [D721.3]. The prince, unable to become a donkey again, wants to flee, but the king stops him and gives him part of his kingdom. Cf. Type 425A."
2054,431,The House in the Forest,"Three sisters one after the other go to a house in the forest where an old man lives with his three animals [D1890, D166.1.1, D166.1, D133.1]. The two older girls cook and make a bed only for the man, not for the animals, nor do they wait for the old man to go to bed before they do [Q2]. He shuts them up in his cellar. The youngest girl takes care of the animals, feeds them [L54] and takes the leftovers for herself, and goes to bed only after the old man is settled down for the night. She wakes up in a palace. Instead of the old man, she finds a young prince, who, together with his three servants, had been enchanted by a witch. The girl and the prince marry [L162], and the sisters must serve as maids until they prove themselves to be sympathetic to animals. In some variants a woman spoils her lazy, bad-tempered daughter and mistreats the industrious stepsister, giving her only a little food. She follows a rolling loaf of bread to a (enchanted) house in the forest. She shares her food with animals who live there (whom she has brought with her) and is kind to an old man or an animal-man (forest spirit). On the advice of the animals, she takes the man to bed with her, and he is disenchanted (along with the animals) [D731]. She marries the man or is given a reward. The jealous sister comes to the house with good food, but does not share it with the animals, so they do not give her advice. She is unkind to the old man (spirit) and is (severely) punished. Cf. Type 480."
2055,432,The Prince as Bird,"The youngest of three sisters asks her father, when he goes on a journey, to bring her an unusual present (feather, plant, book, violin, mirror, pearl, etc.) [L221]. The father at first cannot find such a thing, but then he obtains it from an unknown prince. (Cf. Types 425A, 425B, 425C, 894.) The daughter uses the present to call its owner, who comes (in bird form) through her window [D641.1]. The envious sisters (stepmother) spy and discover the lover. They put knives or broken glass around the window [K2212.1, S181]. The prince is wounded and does not visit any more. The youngest daughter (disguises herself as a man [K1837] and) goes to look for her lover [H1385.5]. She overhears a conversation between birds (demonic beings, who meet in or under a tree) who speak about where the prince is and how he can be cured by a medicine [N452]. The woman prepares the medicine, finds her lover, and heals him. In payment, he gives her a present (ring, hair, shirt, horse). The prince recognizes his love. Or, back home, she summons him by means of the feather (etc.). He comes but is angry because he believes that she had injured him, and she explains what really happened. She shows him the second present (ring, shirt etc.) to prove that it was she who had cured him. They are reconciled [B642]."
2056,433B,King Lindorm,"(Including the previous Types 433, 433A, and 433C.) Cf. Type 430. This tale deals with a brave woman who marries a snake (worm, frog or toad, lizard, another animal). She disenchants him by kissing or embracing him or by sharing his bed [D735.1], or because she wears more shirts than he has layers of skin. (Previously Types 433 and 433A.) Cf. Types 425A, 441, 480, 711. This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A poor woman gives birth to a snake (a couple adopt a snake or a frog as their child). When the animal grows up he wants to marry the daughter of the king. The king sets impossible tasks, which the snake accomplishes (the snake frightens the king). The snake marries the princess, and after the wedding he turns into a handsome man (prince). (2) A childless queen (through a hasty wish [T513] or magic conception [T510]) gives birth to an animal son (snake, dragon, etc.) whom she keeps secret. When he grows up he wants to marry, but every woman who marries him is killed on her wedding night. One courageous young woman (a mistreated stepdaughter) puts on seven shirts one on top of the other (on the advice of a wise woman, her dead mother). She challenges the snake to shed one of his skins every time she takes off one of her shirts. When he is completely stripped, she whips him and then bathes him in milk [D766.1]. She lies down beside him and he turns into a handsome young man. (The skins are destroyed [D721.3].) (3) A young woman marries a snake who gives her jewelry and turns into a handsome young man. The woman burns the snake skin and lives happily with her husband. Another jealous woman tells her father she too wants to marry a snake. She is left in a room alone with such an animal, who kills her. (Previously Type 433C.) In some variants after the husband is disenchanted, the woman is (slandered by a jealous woman and) banished. She disenchants a prince (who has been transformed into a bird) or a dead man, marries him, and gives birth to a son. Her first husband finds her after a long search. She must choose between the husbands and decides to stay with the first."
2057,434,The Stolen Jewelry (previously The Stolen Mirror),"(In order to avert a prophecy, a princess is confined to a tower or underground cave.) A prince in the form of a bird [D150] visits her three times and each time takes something away (jewelry, comb, mirror, hair ribbon). The princess becomes lovesick [T24.1] and goes to find the bird [H1385.5]. She learns (from an old man) where the bird has gone [H1233.1] and discovers that he can change into a handsome young man. She becomes pregnant by him and, in his mothers house, gives birth to a child. She learns (from him) how she can disenchant him. She fulfills the requirements (together with his mother) and he is disenchanted. Cf. Type 425E."
2058,434*,The Diver,"(Cola Pesce.) A man skilled in diving lives like a fish in the sea (and sometimes transforms himself into an ocean animal). The king summons him and orders him to go and report on various places under the water. The diver complies at first, but then he refuses to go to a particularly dangerous place. The king throws his crown into the sea [H1132.1.7], sending the diver on a quest from which he never returns. In an Estonian oikotype, the diver is in love with a princess. A jealous suitor tells her [H911] to throw a piece of jewelry into the sea for the diver to retrieve [cf. H1132.1.7]. The diver transforms himself into a duck and accomplishes this task [D161, D641]. He turns back into his human form [D700] and marries the princess [L161]."
2059,440,The Frog King or Iron Henry,"A young princess (youngest of three sisters) drops her golden ball into a well [C41.2], and a frog [B211.7.1] gives it back to her. (In some variants the frog helps her with some other difficulty.) He makes her promise him that he may eat from her plate, drink from her cup, and sleep in her bed [S215.1]. The animal comes for his reward and the king insists the princess do as she had promised. Angry, she throws the frog at the wall and he turns into a handsome prince [D789]. In some variants the frog is disenchanted by means of a kiss, marriage, from being decapitated, etc. [D735.1, D743, D711]. In the Grimms version: When the prince takes the princess home in his carriage, they meet his faithful servant Henry, whose heart had broken when the prince was enchanted. The iron bands that had held it together break from joy [F875]. In some variants the bride has the iron bands on her heart, and they break from pain, not from joy. After the disenchantment, both partners may be put to a test. The princess searches all over the world for her bridegroom, and he must identify his true bride. Cf. Types 313, 425A."
2060,441,Hans my Hedgehog,"A previously-childless couple (because of a hasty wish or a curse) have a son who is a hedgehog [C758.1, T554]. He becomes a swineherd in the forest, where the pigs thrive under his care. He gives directions to three (two) kings (merchant, count, king, one king three times, etc.) who have lost their way, and is promised one of their three daughters as his wife [S226]. Riding on a rooster, he goes to claim his bride three times. Two of the princesses refuse him and he scratches them, but the third agrees to marry him [B641.5]. On the wedding night (on the way to the church, after they have lived together), the animals skin is destroyed (the princess kisses the hedgehog, whips him, cuts off his head, etc.). The hedgehog is disenchanted and turns into a handsome young man [D721.3]. (The two other princesses kill themselves from jealousy and anger.) Cf. Types 425C, 433B."
2061,442,The Old Woman in the Forest (previously The Old Man in the Forest),"Robbers attack a group of travelers, and a poor servant girl survives by hiding in a tree. In the evening a dove brings her keys that unlock three trees in which she finds food, clothing, and a bed. The dove tells her to go to a little house where she will find an old woman. She should not answer any of her questions but should bring back a plain ring, leaving the shiny one there. The girl does as the dove ordered, and does not let the old woman distract her. She stops the old woman from running away with a bird cage, and finds the ring in the birds beak. While waiting for the dove, the girl puts the ring on her finger [D1076]. Immediately a tree envelops her with its branches and turns into a handsome young prince [D431.2] who explains that he had been enchanted by the witch. Other trees turn into servants and horses. The prince takes the girl to his kingdom, where they marry [L162]. Cf. Type 405."
2062,444*,Enchanted Prince Disenchanted,"(Including the previous Types 432*, 444A*, 444B*, 444D*, and 444E*.) Miscellaneous type. A prince is transformed (by a supernatural being) into an animal (monkey, fish, dragon, bird, cat, wild boar, etc.). He is disenchanted by a woman who sympathizes with him or helps him (by performing a task, obtaining a magic object, etc.)."
2063,449,Sidi Numan (previously The Tsars Dog [Sidi Numan]),"(Including the previous Type 1898*.) This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A man discovers that his wife eats corpses in the night. When he accuses her of this, she turns him into a dog. Another sorceress recognizes that the dog is really a human and returns him to his original form. With her help the husband is able to turn his wife into a mare and he beats her (to death). (2) An unfaithful wife turns her husband into a dog [D141, K1535], which herds sheep and also rescues the kings baby [D682.3]. When he returns to his wife, she turns him into a bird [D151.8]. He finds a magic wand, becomes a man again, and changes his wife and her lover into donkeys [D682.3]."
2064,400,The Man on a Quest for his Lost Wife,"(Including the previous Types 400*, 401, and 401A.) This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A man in distress (impoverished fisherman, merchant) unwittingly promises his (unborn) son to the devil [S240]. When the boy is delivered to him later, the devil cannot use him because he is protected by magic [K218.2] (cf. Type 810). Thus the boy is cast out in the sea (river, desert). He arrives in a foreign country and finds a lonely castle where he meets a bewitched princess (maiden, fairy) in the form of a serpent (deer). He rescues her by enduring three nights of torture [D758.1]. They marry [F302, L161]. When he wants to visit his parents, his wife gives him a ring to carry him home [D1470.1.15], and she forbids him to call her to come to him [C31.6] (to boast of her beauty [C31.5]). At home he is induced (by his mother) to break the taboo. His wife appears [D2074.2.3.1], takes the ring, and leaves him destitute. The man sets out in search of his wife [H1385.3]. On his way he meets three hermits (rulers of animal kingdoms, or moon, sun, and wind) whom he asks for directions [B221, H1232, H1235]. With the help of the third he arrives at the empire of his wife, or he pretends that he wants to help three giants who are fighting over magic objects (inheritance, booty). He steals the magic objects (magic sword [D1400.1.4], magic coat or hood [D1361.14], seven-league boots [D1521.1]) [D831, D832] (cf. Type 518). With their help he is able to overcome the obstacles on the way to his wife [D2121]. When he finds his wife, she is about to marry another man [N681]. He discloses his identity as her real husband. (2) Meeting the princess and disenchantment as in version (1); but the disenchantment is not complete. The princess wants to travel back to her own distant land. She asks her rescuer to wait for her at a certain time and place. She appears three times, but each time a servant (witch) has put her husband into a deep sleep from which he cannot be awakened [D1364.15, D1364.4.1, D1972]. The princess informs him (in a letter) how and where to find her ( on the glass mountain). The man sets out to find her. Continued as in version (1). (3) A youth watches a flock of birds (swans, ducks, geese, doves) land on the shore. The birds take off their feather coats and become beautiful maidens [D361.1]. While they are bathing, the youth steals the feather coat of the most beautiful girl, who cannot leave with the others and thus must marry the youth [D721.2, B652.1]. Later, because of carelessness (of the mans mother), the maiden takes back her coat [D361.1.1] and flies away (together with her children). She tells the youth her destination in the otherworld (e.g. glass mountain). The man sets out in search of his wife (as in version 1). Some variants include elements from Type 313 (Magic Flight)."
2065,401A*,The Soldiers in the Enchanted Castle,"Miscellaneous type. Twelve (seven, three) soldiers (deserters) come (often with the help of an animal or person) to a lonely castle (small house), where they receive food and lodging. A white woman (maiden who appears in a dream) asks them to stay in the castle for seven years (one year and two days) (to keep guard for three nights) and to fulfill certain conditions (not to think of a maiden, not to touch or look at the maidens who sleep in their beds, not to open a certain door). They disobey the prohibition and flee, or all (but one) leave the castle before the end of the vigil. Thus their efforts to disenchant the princesses who live in the castle are unsuccessful [D759.9]. The soldiers often return later, and the one is rewarded (often after having performed different tasks), but the others are killed. In some variants the soldiers succeed in disenchanting the princesses and each of them marries one of them (seven seven-year-old boys finally break the spell) [D759.10]."
2066,402,"The Animal Bride (previously The Mouse [Cat, Frog, etc","] as Bride). A father is not able to decide which of his (three) sons should inherit his property (kingdom) and sends them all on a quest for one year [H1210.1]. They are told to bring back a special object (yarn, linen [H1306], fine chain [H1303], ring, horse, smallest dog [H1307], money) or they must learn a profession. Whoever performs the task best will be the heir. The youngest son, often a fool, goes into a forest and becomes the servant of an animal (cat [B422], rat, frog [B493.1], mouse [B437.2]). As a payment he is given the object that his father had asked for. It proves to be the most beautiful one, and thus he should be the heir [H1242]. Because his brothers (parents) are envious, two further tasks are set, and finally the brothers are required to bring a bride (most beautiful woman [H1301.1]). The youngest returns to the animal which again promises to help. The animal is disenchanted by burning, mutilation, decapitation [D711], or by crossing a river [B313, D700], and becomes a beautiful princess with a castle. They return happily to his parents as bride and bridegroom. Sometimes they deceive the parents: The youngest son arrives dressed in rags and is ridiculed; then the bride arrives and they reveal their identities. When the son arrives in the first place dressed as a prince, a mole helps to identify him. Often the youngest son renounces his inheritance and goes with his wife back to her castle. In some variants from eastern and southeastern Europe and the Near East, the youngest son takes the animal (often a frog or toad) to his home and hides it from the family. The father assigns tasks to his daughters-in-law which the frog performs best. The last (third) task requires the brides to attend a feast, where the frog turns into the most beautiful woman. The bridegroom burns the frogs skin so that the bride cannot change back. As a consequence she leaves him, and he sets out on a quest and finally is able to retrieve her. Cf. Type 400."
2067,402*,"The Princess who Scorned an Unloved Suitor is turned into a frog (mouse, etc",")[T75.1, D661]. She is disenchanted (by another man) and her animal skin is burned in order to prevent her from changing back. Cf. Type 400."
2068,402A*,The Princess Transformed into a Toad,"A princess who has been transformed into a toad (old witch, etc.)is disenchanted by a young mans kiss (pity) and marries him. Cf. Type 440."
2069,403,The Black and the White Bride,"(Including the previous Types 403A and 403B.) A stepmother hates her stepchildren [S31]. The stepdaughter is kind to someone she meets (e.g. Christ and St. Peter) (she is sent after strawberries in winter [H1023.3], and meets dwarfs who help her). In return she is given great beauty [D1860] (the power of dropping gold or jewels from her mouth [D1454.2, D1454.1.2]). The stepmothers own daughter is unkind under these conditions and is made ugly [D1870] (made to drop toads from her mouth [M431.2]) [Q2]. The stepdaughters brother is in service at the court of a king. He takes his sisters picture with him. The king sees the girls picture, falls in love with her, and sends the brother for her [T11.2]. (The beautiful stepdaughter is seen accidentally by a king or prince, who marries her [N711, L162].) On their journey to the kings court, the stepmother or stepsister casts the true bride out of the carriage (overboard) [S432]. The king marries the ugly stepsister [K1911], and the brother is thrown into prison or a pit of snakes [Q465.1]. (The kings wife gives birth to a child. The stepmother throws her and her child into the water and substitutes her own daughter for the bride [K1911.1.2].) The true bride is transformed to a duck (goose) [D161.2], and comes to the kings court three times (to care for her child [D688]). The last night the king wakes and disenchants her by decapitation [D711] (cutting her golden belt, holding her during successive transformations [D712.4]). The brother, unharmed in the den of snakes [B848], is rescued. The true bride is married or reinstated, and the false bride and her mother are punished [Q261]. Cf. Types 450, 480, 510B, 511."
2070,403C,The Substituted Bride (previously The Witch Secretly Substitutes her own Daughter),"A witch secretly substitutes her own daughter for the bride. On the way to his home, the bridegroom discovers the substitution and throws the witchs daughter out of the carriage. The girl falls down to the earth (under a bridge), and from her navel grows a reed in which the witch recognizes her own daughter."
2071,404,The Blinded Bride,"(Previously Type 533* and part of Type 533.) A girl is blessed at birth by fairies (is kind to a snake) who cause her to produce gold (jewels, flowers) from her hands (mouth [D1454.2], footsteps [D1454.7], tears [D1454.4]). A king sees the girl and wants to marry her. Her wicked stepmother (aunt) and stepsister accompany her on the journey to the kings court. On the way, the girls stepmother feeds her with salty food. When the girl asks for water, the stepmother puts out both of her eyes [S165] or mutilates her. They take her clothes and throw her into the sea. The stepsister, posing as the bride, marries the king. A kind fisherman (poor man) finds the blinded girl, takes her home, and becomes rich from the gold from her hands. He uses the gold (jewels, flowers) to buy back the girls eyes [E781.2] (the snake commands this). The girl recovers her sight, dresses in beautiful clothes, and goes to the kings court. The king recognizes her when she washes her hands. He marries her, and the wicked women are burned. (The snake is the girls guardian angel and returns to heaven.)"
2072,405,Jorinde and Joringel,"The lovers Jorinde and Joringel accidentally go to the magic forest of a sorceress (witch). She transforms Jorinde, as she has many other girls before, into a bird [D683.2, D150] and keeps her in a cage. Joringel dreams about a magic flower, goes on a search, and finds it. He touches Jorinde and all the other birds with the flower and thus changes them back into their former shapes [D771]. Cf. Type 442."
2073,406,The Cannibal,"A couple have a child who is a cannibal [G33] who eats everyone up. A man succeeds in breaking the enchantment [D716], and the cannibal is transformed into a maiden [D11.1]. They are married [T101]. Cf. Types 307, 315A."
2074,407,The Girl as Flower,"(Including the previous Types 407A, 407B, 652A, and 702B*.) This tale exists chiefly in three different forms: (1) A girl (woman, fairy) has been transformed into a flower (twig, bush, tree, fruit) (transforms herself) [D212]. A man (her predestined lover) breaks a stalk and the flower changes back into a girl [D711.4] (he takes the girl in the form of a flower on a journey with him and transforms it afterwards). He marries her [T101] (sometimes her vegetable clothing has to be burned). Cf. Type 652. (2) After a hasty wish, a woman gives birth to a twig (bush, fruit) [T513, T555], plants it in a pot, and cares for it as for a child. A prince is irresistibly drawn to the plant and becomes love-sick [T24.1]. He obtains the plant. During the night a girl comes out of it, eats, and makes love with him. When the prince has to go to war, the girl stays in the plant. The prince attaches a bell to the plant which he will ring when he wants to call the girl. An envious woman (fiance) signals the girl to come. She appears and is killed, and her plant is destroyed. A compassionate woman resuscitates the girl [E0], and the rival is punished. (Previously Types 407A and 652A. Because of its structural similarity, also the previous Type 702B* is integrated here.) (3) A beautiful girl wants to have a lover, even if he is the devil (a dead man) [C15]. The devil comes in the form of an attractive man (with animal feet). She follows him and sees him eating corpses in a church [G20.1]. Several times she is asked whether she had seen anything. She denies this repeatedly, even when the devil kills her sister, mother, and father. At last she herself dies. Because she had made special arrangements for her funeral, the devil cannot find her. Cf. Types 363, 1476B. From her grave grows a beautiful flower (lily, rose, tulip) [E631.1] which only her predestined husband (nobleman, prince) is able to pick. Because she has to eat, at night she becomes a beautiful woman. Her husband takes her as his wife (often on the condition that he may not talk about her or present her in public, so that the devil will not be able to find her). The couple succeeds in tricking or killing the devil (the devil takes the woman to hell). (Previously Type 407B.)"
2075,408,The Three Oranges,"A prince insolently breaks an old womans jar (makes her angry in another way). She utters a curse: he is to fall in love with three oranges (lemons, other fruits, girls of magic origin) [S375]. The prince sets out on a (sometimes very long) quest during which he is given directions, advice, and help to overcome obstacles. The prince finds the fruits in a garden (castle). When he opens them, out of each comes a beautiful, often naked, young woman who asks for water (comb, mirror, towel, clothes, etc.)[D721.5]. The prince can give only the third woman what she asks for, and the other girls die (disappear, return into the fruits). The prince hides the woman on a tree besides a fountain while he goes to get clothes (carriage, company) for her. An ugly black woman (Gypsy woman, witch) comes to get water. She thinks that the reflection of the Orange Girl is her own [J1791.6.1], and breaks her water jar because she thinks she is too beautiful to carry water. The Orange Girl laughs, and the black woman discovers her. The black woman succeeds in taking the Orange Girls place (two different versions). The prince returns, and though he is astonished at the sudden change (excuses: sunburn, influences of wind and weather), he marries the false bride. (1) The black woman pushes the Orange Girl into the water [K1911.2.2], where she changes into a fish [D170] (bird [D150]). The false bride demands that it be killed, but from its remains grows a tree. She demands it be felled, but an old woman (man) takes away a splinter (log) [D610]. Out of this once again comes the Orange Girl, who secretly does the old womans housework. The old woman finds the girl and adopts her. The prince recognizes her when he hears her life history (when the girl tends one of his horses) [K1911.3]. (2) The black woman combs (louses) the Orange Girl and sticks a magic needle into her head. The girl changes into a dove [D150] and flies to the castle. The gardener (cook) hears the birds song asking about the prince and his black wife. The dove is captured and the prince is much pleased with it. He finds the magic needle and removes it, and thus the dove changes back into the Orange Girl [K1911.3]. Cf. Type 452B*. After the couples reunion, the false bride is punished (sentenced to a cruel death; she often pronounces her own judgment)."
2076,409,The Girl as Wolf,"An evil stepmother substitutes her own daughter for her married step daughter and transforms the stepdaughter into a wolf (lynx, fox) [D113.1], which hides in the forest. Every day the wolf comes, throws off her animal skin, and suckles her child (the child is brought to the forest). The childs father observes this, recognizes his beloved wife and (on the advice of a magician) burns her animal skin. Thus she is restored to human form [D721.3]. The stepmother and her daughter are executed [Q261]. Cf. Type 403."
2077,409A,The Girl as Goat,"(Including the previous Types 413A* and 413B*.) A childless woman wants a child even if it is only an animal. She bears a girl with an animal form (goat, jackdaw, pig, fish, etc.)[T554]. (An old woman finds a magic pumpkin which, at night, turns into a beautiful woman who cleans her house.) A youth (prince) observes the girl when she (while washing clothes, etc.)has removed her animal skin. He proposes to her and marries her [T111]. His mother disapproves of the marriage and torments the girl (who often plays a trick on her). Three times the girl appears at a festival in her human form, is admired, and dances. Twice she escapes and assumes her goat form. The third time the youth destroys the goat covering and disenchants the girl. Cf. Type 510A. In some variants, another young man decides to get married in the same way. But he is disappointed: his wife, a little pig, never changes into a girl."
2078,409A*,The Girl as Snake (previously Snake Princess is Disenchanted),"A snake which is pulled out of a fire turns into a woman and marries her rescuer. The husband promises never to call his wife snake. When he breaks this promise, the woman changes back into a snake and disappears (is once again delivered by her son-in-law)."
2079,409B*,The Promised Supernatural Wife (previously Child Weeping in his Mothers Womb is Promised Supernatural Wife),"An unborn boy who came into a womans womb by magic conception begins to weep [T575.1]. When someone promises him a supernatural being (fairy) as his wife, he stops crying and is willing to be born. The boy grows up very fast and sets out on a quest for the girl. With the help of supernatural beings he finds her. They marry [T111]."
2080,410,"Sleeping Beauty (Dornrschen, La bella addormentata",") (Announced by a frog [B211.7.1], B493.1) a daughter is born to a royal couple. A fairy (wise woman) who has not been invited to the celebration (baptism) utters a curse that the princess (on her 15th birthday) will die of a wound from a spindle (needle, fiber of flax) [F361.1.1, F316, G269.4, M341.2.13]. Another fairy changes the death sentence into a long (hundred-year) sleep [F316.1]. The king orders that every spindle (needle) in his empire be destroyed; but, because one of them has been overlooked, the prophecy is fulfilled [M370]: The girl meets an old woman who is spinning in a hidden chamber, pricks her finger with the spindle, and sinks, together with the whole court, into a magic sleep [D1364.17, D1960.3, F771.4.4, F771.4.7]. Around the castle grows a hedge of thorns [D1967.1] (the girl is enclosed in a tower). At the end of the appointed time, a youth (prince) breaks through the hedge [N711.2] and awakens the princess with a kiss [D735, D1978.5] (he impregnates her; she gives birth to two children, one of whom sucks the fiber out of her finger and thus disenchants her). In some variants the prince takes his wife and children to his family. During his absence the evil mother-in-law asks the cook to slaughter and roast the woman and the children. The cook disobeys, and the mother-in-law demands that the three be thrown into a tub full of poisonous toads and snakes. Unexpectedly the prince returns home, and the mother-in-law herself jumps into the tub."
2081,410*,The Petrified Kingdom,"A soldier comes to a kingdom where everything has been turned to stone. He spends three successive nights in a castle which is inhabited by evil spirits (devils), without succumbing to fear. All the kingdom revives, and the soldier marries the princess. Cf. Types 304, 307."
2082,411,The King and the Lamia,"A king sees a lovely girl who is actually a snake-woman [B29.1], falls in love, and marries her. Little by little the kings health deteriorates. A fakir tells him to feed his wife salty food and to stay up at night and watch her. The wife assumes her snake form and goes for water. An oven is heated red-hot and the snake is pushed in. A pebble is found in the ashes: Anything that it touches turns into gold [D1469.10.1]."
2083,412,The Maiden (Youth) with a Separable Soul in a Necklace,"Cf. Types 302, 403, 425. A maidens life depends upon her necklace [E711.4] which she must keep safe. She marries a prince. When a jealous girl (stepmother, stranger) steals the necklace, the bride seemingly dies and the jealous girl takes her place. The body of the seemingly dead woman is placed in a church (temple). She comes to life whenever her rival takes off the necklace. The prince finds the body of his wife and recovers the necklace (a son is born who recovers the necklace). The impostor is punished. In some variants, a prince whose soul is in a necklace [E711.4] seemingly dies when the necklace is stolen (by his stepmother). A woman marries the prince and recovers the necklace."
2084,413,The Stolen Clothing (previously Marriage by Stealing Clothing),"A youth comes upon a holy man (old woman) in the forest [N825]. He is told not to go in a certain direction, but when he does so [Z211], he sees three beautiful maidens bathing. The holy man agrees to help him, turns him into a bird, tells him to steal the clothes of one of the bathing girls [K1335], and warns him not to look back under any circumstances [C311]. The first time he does look back and is burned to a pile of ashes. The holy man restores him [E121.5], and the youth succeeds on his second attempt. Cf. Types 400, 408."
2085,300,The Dragon-Slayer,"A youth acquires (e.g. by exchange) three wonderful dogs [B421, B312.2]. He comes to a town where people are mourning and learns that once a year a (seven-headed) dragon [B11.2.3.1] demands a virgin as a sacrifice [B11.10, S262]. In the current year, the kings daughter has been chosen to be sacrificed, and the king offers her as a prize to her rescuer [T68.1]. The youth goes to the appointed place. While waiting to fight with the dragon, he falls into a magic sleep [D1975], during which the princess twists a ring (ribbons) into his hair; only one of her falling tears can awaken him [D1978.2]. Together with his dogs, the youth overcomes the dragon [B11.11, B524.1.1, R111.1.3]. He strikes off the dragons heads and cuts out the tongues (keeps the teeth) [H105.1]. The youth promises the princess to come back in one year (three years) and goes off. An impostor (e.g. the coachman) takes the dragons heads, forces the princess to name him as her rescuer [K1933], and claims her as his reward [K1932]. The princess asks her father to delay the wedding. Just as the princess is about to marry the impostor, the dragon-slayer returns. He sends his dogs to get some food from the kings table and is summoned to the wedding party [H151.2]. There the dragon-slayer proves he was the rescuer by showing the dragons tongues (teeth) [H83, H105.1]. The impostor is condemned to death, and the dragon-slayer marries the princess. Cf. Types 301, 303, 314, 315, 502, 530, 554."
2086,300A,The Fight on the Bridge,"(Including the previous Type 300A*.) After having eaten a (three) fish, the daughter of a tsar, her maid, and a she-dog (cow, mare, cat) give birth to sons at the same time [T511.5.1]. (Cf. Type 303.) The three sons together go out for adventure [F601]. While his brothers are sleeping, the animal son [B631] (often a fool) fights against a three-headed dragon [B11.2.3.2] on a bridge. In the following two nights he defeats six- [B11.2.3.3], twelve- [B11.2.3.5] or multi-headed [B11.2.3, B11.11] dragons (is able to defeat the third one only with the help of his horse [B401]). (In the form of a fly [D185.3], cat [D142] or the like), the animal son overhears the conversations of the dragon-wives (dragon-daughters) [N451], defeats their enchantments, and thus saves his brothers. The dragons mother pursues the three brothers and devours two of them [B11.10.3]. The animal son hides in a magic forge. He outwits the dragons mother, who spits out the brothers she had devoured. Together with the smiths, the animal son kills the dragons mother, and the smiths forge her to a horse. Cf. Type 705A. In some cases, a magical old man (father of the slain dragons) defeats the animal son in a contest (horse race) and takes away his horse. The old man sends out a hero in order to win a bride (often a transition to Type 513A). In addition to this regular form, there exist two versions without the introductory part of the magic conception: (1) The dragon-slayer wins back the celestial lights which the dragon had stolen and gives them to men. (Previously Type 300A*.) Cf. Type 328A*. (2) The animal son defeats the strongest dragon and wins his horse for the tsar."
2087,301,The Three Stolen Princesses,"(Including the previous Types 301A and 301B.) This type combines various introductory episodes with a common main part: Introductory episodes: (1) A king banishes his three daughters to the underworld (they are abducted by monsters [H1385.1]). Three brothers (a supernatural hero with his extraordinary companions) go to find the daughters. (2) A monster (dragon, snake, etc.)steals golden apples from the kings garden. Three brothers (princes) lie in wait. Only the youngest is able to wound the monster. The brothers follow his bloody tracks [F102.1, N773]. (3) A child of magic birth (son of a bear or horse [B631], born from tears) grows into a youth gifted with exceptional strength [T615]. He takes to the road for adventure (luck), and allies himself with two companions with extraordinary powers [F601]. When they prepare their food, twice a little man (dwarf, devil, giant) spoils it (eats the food and beats up the cook) [F451.5.2]. Only the hero is able to catch and punish the little man, who then shows the companions the entrance to the underworld. Main part: The companions (brothers) come to a well (pit, cave) [F92] and lower the hero (youngest brother) into it [F96]. The hero overcomes monsters (dragons, devils) and rescues (the three) princesses (with the princesses help, using a weapon, only by his strength, by magic means) [R111.2.1]. (The princesses give him presents.) His treacherous companions pull the princesses up but leave the hero below [K1931.2] (cut off the rope [K963], overturn the basket). They force the maidens to name them as their rescuers [K1933]. The hero returns to the upper world with the help of a spirit, which gives him the ability to fly (a bird to whom he has to feed his own flesh [B322.1]; he ascends on a climbing plant which he himself planted, etc.). The princesses delay their wedding (for a year). On the wedding day, the hero comes to the castle and is imprisoned. But the truth comes to light (the hero is recognized by the princesses when he shows the presents [H80]), and the impostors are punished (banished, killed) [Q262]. The hero marries the youngest princess [L161] and becomes king. Cf. Type 300. In some variants, the hero has to go to much deeper regions of the underworld before he is able to come back to the upper world, because he mistakenly mounted a black animal (ram, sheep, goat, horse, lion, snake) instead of a white one. Finally the white animal carries him up again."
2088,301D*,The Princesss Ring (previously Dragons Ravish Princesses),"When she goes for a walk, a princess (daughter of a tsar) disappears. Her father promises her to whoever finds and rescues her [T68.1]. A soldier takes a ship and goes out to search for the princess. On a lonely island he meets a dragon (giant, devil), makes him drunk with wine, cuts off his head and takes away his keys [B11.11]. He finds the princess and takes her to the ship. Just when they are about to sail, the princess asks for a ring she forgot, and the soldier goes back to get it. Meanwhile the ship sails away and the treacherous captain forces the princess to name him as her rescuer [K1933]. The soldier takes service with robbers (devils, magician) and finds magic objects in a forbidden room of their house [C611] (castle) (gets them as payment). With the help of these objects he gets back home. On her wedding day with the captain, the princess recognizes the soldier by her ring [H94], tells her father the truth, and marries the soldier [L161]. Cf. Types 301, 505."
2089,302,The Ogres (Devils) Heart in the Egg,"(Including the previous Types 302A*, 302B*, and 425P.) Because he helped some animals to divide a meal in a fair manner, a youth is rewarded with the ability to transform himself into their shapes (they promise their help because he spared or nourished them) [B393, B500, D1834]; cf. Type 554. He goes to rescue a princess who has been abducted by an ogre (giant, dragon, devil) (to rescue his wife who has been abducted by a supernatural enemy, cf. Type 400) [R11.1]. As an eagle, the youth comes to the ogres castle, as an ant into the princesss chamber [D152.2, D182.2]. He learns from the princess that the ogre cannot be defeated because his heart (power of life, soul) is hidden outside of his body [E710]. The princess elicits the hiding place from the ogre [K975.2]: His heart lies enclosed in various animals in an egg (little box) [E711.1, E713]; cf. Type 590. The youth follows the princesss instructions, finds the ogres soul, and destroys it (the grateful animals do so for him [B571.1]). The ogre dies [K956], and the youth marries the princess [L161]. Cf. Type 665."
2090,302B,Life Dependent on a Sword (previously Hero with Life Dependent on his Sword),"(Including the previous Type 516B.) A childless couple magically conceive a son [T510]. An old man (his father, God) gives the son a sword (knife) which he should always carry with him (should not lay it on the ground, not pull out from its sheath). Or: The youngest of three brothers inherits a horse, clothes, and a sabre from his father, and goes out for adventure, accompanied by some companions (blood-brothers) with magic powers [F601]. With the aid of his sword he defeats the kings army and kills a dragon(s). His companions marry the rescued women. The youth himself marries a woman of extraordinary beauty. When the king catches a sight of her picture [T11.2] or of a curl (ring, slipper) which she lost in the sea (river), he falls in love with her and sends out an old woman (witch) to capture her. By a trick the old woman enters the youths house, learns the secret of the sword [E711.10], and throws it into the sea. Deprived of his strength, the youth dies, and his wife is taken to the king. Through a life token, the youths friends discover what has happened, recover the sword, restore it to its original condition, and resuscitate the youth. The youth creeps into the kings castle, hides in the room of his wife, kills the king (the old woman), and becomes king himself. Cf. Type 318."
2091,302C*,The Magic Horse,"(Including the previous Type 422*.) At the wish of the dead king, his youngest son permits his three sisters to marry the first suitors who come for them. Visiting his brothers-in-law, he learns that they are the masters of the three kingdoms of animals. The prince wins a wife who forbids him to enter a certain room [C611]. He disregards her prohibition and revives a dragon (demon) who is impaled on a wall (contained in a hoop). The dragon frees himself and abducts the princes wife. The prince searches for her and three times tries to flee with her. Riding on his magic horse, the dragon overtakes the two but does not kill the prince, because he promised to spare his life three times; the fourth time, he cuts him up. Signals of distress tell the brothers-in-law that the prince is in danger, and they come and resuscitate him. He goes back to the dragon, asks his wife to find out where the magic horse came from, and learns that a certain witch owns one. On his way to the witch, the prince wins the gratitude of three animals which help him to tend the witchs three horses (daughters) that live in the earth, the clouds, and the sea. In payment, the prince choses a scabby foal which turns into a magic horse (with extra legs), and he and his wife flee on his back. The magic horse is the brother of the dragons horse, and it compells the latter to throw off its rider, the dragon. The dragon is killed, and the prince returns home together with his wife. Cf. Type 552."
2092,303,The Twins or Blood-Brothers,"(Including the previous Types 553 and 581.) After having eaten a magic fish (apple, water) [T511.5.1, T511.1.1, T512], a woman gives birth to twins. (Cf. Type 705A.) Grateful animals accompany the grown-up brothers, or animals give them one or more of their young ones because the brothers did not kill them. (The brothers are given unusual animals; they win them or bring them up; in some variants, the animals are born at the same time as the brothers [T589.7.1].) Together with his animals, one of the brothers sets out. When the brothers separate, they agree upon a life token that gives a warning when one of them is in mortal danger and needs help: Water will become cloudy, a plant or a tree dry up, a knife stuck in a tree will grow rusty, etc. [E761]. The first brother frees a princess (three princesses) from a dragon (trolls), unmasks an impostor (Red Knight) who pretended to be the princesss rescuer, and marries the princess [R111.1.3, K1932, H83, L161]. Cf. Type 300. Against a warning, the hero follows a light [G451] (is tempted by an animal). He falls into the power of a witch and is turned to stone [D231]. His twin brother is warned by the life token and sets forth in quest of him. The princess mistakes him for her husband, as the two brothers are very much alike [K1311.1]. At night the brother puts a naked sword in the bed between himself and his sister-in-law [T351]. Then he finds the witch, makes her remove the spell from his brother, and kills her. The first brother learns that the second has slept with his wife and kills him out of jealousy [N342.3]. Later on, when he asks his wife why she had put the sword in the bed, he realizes that his brother was innocent. The brother is resuscitated by magic means [B512] (water of life). In some variants, a youth saves the life of a raven (crane, eagle). As a reward he obtains magic objects. The youth defeats a sea monster, delivers three princesses, and marries the youngest of them. (Previously Type 553.)"
2093,303A,Brothers Seek Sisters as Wives (previously Six Brothers Seek Seven Sisters as Wives),"A number of brothers (usually six, twelve or one hundred) set out to find a number of sisters as wives for themselves and their youngest brother who remained home [T69.1]. On the way an old man (giant, troll) transforms the brothers and their brides into stone and takes the youngest bride for himself [D231, R11.1]. The youngest brother goes to look for his lost brothers and comes to the old mans house. Here he finds the youngest bride who tells him that the heart (life) of the old man is enclosed in a bird [E715.1]. With the help of grateful animals which he had fed on his way, the youngest brother catches the bird and kills it, thus killing the old man (he rescues his brothers and the brides by performing different tasks). Brothers and brides are restored to life [R155.1]. Cf. Type 302. In some variants, the brothers marry the daughters of a witch. During the night in bed the brothers exchange their places with those of their wives. The witch kills her own daughters. Cf. Type 1119."
2094,304,The Dangerous Night-Watch (previously The Hunter),"Together with his brothers (companions), a youth (youngest of three brothers, hunter, prince, soldier, etc.)has various hunting adventures, or he defeats dragons (wild animals, monsters) during one (three) night-watch(es) in the forest (at his fathers grave). While the youth fights, his fire (light) goes out (the youth loses his way, is tempted away by a bird). He (stops time and) meets giants (robbers, supernatural beings) whom he impresses by shooting tricks [F666.1] or by his extraordinary physical strength. The giants go to plunder a castle (town) or to carry off a princess, and take the youth with them. The youth shoots a watchdog (rooster), enters the castle first, calls the giants and, as they enter, he cuts off their heads one at a time [K912]. Often he cuts off their tongues (heads, other parts of the body) which he takes away as trophies [H83]. Cf. Type 300. In the castle, the youth comes to a room where a princess lies sleeping [N711.2]. He looks at her (falls in love, kisses her, rapes her) and, before leaving, takes a souvenir (jewelry, handkerchief, shoes, etc.)which later becomes a token [H81.1, H81.1.1, T475.2]; cf. Types 301, 301D*. Then he returns with a burning log (lets time resume) and kindles the fire again. An impostor pretends that he had killed the giants and claims the (pregnant) princess for his wife. The princess refuses to marry him. She sets up (is made to live in) an inn [Q481] where guests need not pay anything if they tell a tale (life-history, news). (Accompanied by his brothers and mother,) the youth stops at this inn, proves his identity by means of his tale and the tokens, and marries the princess [H11.1.1, H81, L161]. The impostor is punished."
2095,305,The Dragons Heart-blood as Remedy [D1500,"1.7.3.3]. This tale exists chiefly in four different forms (cf. Types 314, 551, 673): (1) A king falls ill and learns that he can only be cured by the milk and blood of a dragons heart. He promises his oldest daughter to whoever is able to get the remedy, and his youngest daughter to whoever assists. A nobleman and a farmer boy set out and, with the help of an old woman, arrive at the dragons forest. The farmer boy kills the dragon, squeezes milk and blood out of its heart, and hides them. Threatening to kill him, the nobleman takes the dragons heart, presents it to the king and wins the eldest daughter and the kingdom [K1935]. The farmer boy and the youngest daughter are sent to live in the goose house. Because there were neither milk nor blood in the dragons heart, the nobleman, the farmer boy, and the old woman are questioned. Truth comes to light, and the kingdom goes to the farmer boy. (2) During his travels, a workman learns that the sick king can only be cured by a dragons liver. He sees the dragons vulnerable spot in a dream. He kills the dragon and boasts of his victory in an inn. The host steals the mans knapsack which, however, contains only a stone. The workman arrives at the kings court prior to the host, cures the king, and wins the princess as his wife. The thievish host is hanged. (3) A father orders his son to bring him the devils tongue to cure his illness, but the son cannot find the devil. An old man advises him to knock with a stick on a certain trunk. A horse appears and carries him to the devil. The horse gives the son a piece of his hoof which he can use to call it whenever he is in danger. The son challenges the devil, but, during the fight, the devil thrusts him into the earth up to his waist. With the help of the horse, the son defeats the devil, brings the devils tongue to his father, and thus cures him. (4) While hunting, a prince is bewitched and loses his voice. A young woman appears in his dream and tells him about a remedy: a medicine consisting of dragons eyes, a dragons heart and other ingredients, which must be prepared in a certain manner. In return the young woman demands that the prince marry her. After the prince agrees, a youth appears and produces the medicine in the prescribed way. The cure is successful, and the prince marries the young woman."
2096,306,The Danced-out Shoes,"(Including the previous Type 306A.) Every day, a princess(es) wears out a pair of shoes. Her father wants to know why and offers the princess (one of the princesses) to whoever discovers the secret [H508.2]. Anyone who fails will lose his head. A youth (soldier, Gypsy, tailor, shepherd, farmer, etc.)acquires a magic object (e.g. shoes, cap, overcoat, stick) which makes him invisible [D1980]. He refuses a narcotic drink and does not fall asleep [K625.1]. After making himself invisible, the youth accompanies the princess on a magical underground journey [D2131]. In the underworld he watches the princess wear out her shoes by dancing with the devil (dragon, other supernatural beings) [F1015.1.1]. The next morning the youth tells the king what happened and corroborates his tale by tokens (e.g. twigs, apples, ring, piece of the princesss garment) from the underworld [H80]. He marries the princess [L161] and becomes king. Cf. Type 507A. Mainly in Indian variants, a prince accompanies his wife to the otherworld where she has to dance each night before a divinity. He frees her [F87]. (Previously Type 306A.)"
2097,307,The Princess in the Coffin (previously The Princess in the Shroud),"(Including the previous Types 307B* and 307C*.) After a hasty wish (curse), a diabolic (black, mute) daughter is born to a childless couple (king and queen) [C758.1, S223]. The daughter demands that when she dies, there should be a night-watch at her coffin in the church (graveyard) (someone should watch over her for three nights in order to save her). The dead girl rises every night from the coffin and swallows the man on guard [E251]. A soldier (boy) learns from an old man what he must do to free the girl from the witchcraft [N825.2]. During the first two nights, he hides from the dead girl. During the third night, when the girl leaves the coffin, the soldier lies down in it, refuses to let her in, and forces her (by means of a rusty sword) to say a paternoster (sing a hymn at the altar). As she says the prayer, the rooster crows and the girl is disenchanted [D791.1.7]. The guards are revived and the girl marries her rescuer [L162]. (The soldier tears his bride into two parts and shakes out the bad spirit in the form of reptiles.) Various other magic or religious means can be used to save the princess."
2098,310,The Maiden in the Tower,"(Petrosinella, Rapunzel.) A (pregnant) woman steals herbs (fruits) from the garden of a witch (sorceress) [G279.2] and is forced to promise her unborn child to the witch [S222.1]. The woman bears a girl, and after a certain time the witch comes for the daughter (often called Petrosinella, Rapunzel, etc. according to the name of the stolen plant) [G204]. The witch locks her up in a tower [R41.2]. Whenever the witch wants to visit her, she enters by climbing on the girls long (golden) hair as on a ladder [F848.1]. A prince discovers the girl in the tower because of her hair shining in the sun [F555] and falls in love with her. The girl gives the witch a sleeping-draught. The prince climbs up on the girls hair and they have a love affair. The witch finds out about the nocturnal visits of the prince. She wants to prevent further visits, but accidentally discloses that the lovers could flee by transforming themselves with the help of three oak galls. The girl overhears the conversation [N455] and explains the magic oak galls to the prince. They flee together and are pursued by the witch. They escape [D642.7] and the witch is killed. The prince marries the girl [L162]."
2099,311,Rescue by the Sister,"Two sisters, one after the other, fall into power of a demonic suitor (cannibal, dragon, magician, devil) and are taken into his (subterranean) castle [R11.1, T721.5]. There the sisters open a forbidden room full of dead bodies, in the course of which the key (a magic egg, apple) becomes bloody, or they refuse to eat human flesh [C611, C227, C913]. The demon kills them for their disobedience [C920]. Using a trick, the third (youngest) sister escapes from the same fate. She finds her sisters and resuscitates them by putting their bones together [R157.1]. She hides them beneath some gold in baskets (bags) and persuades the demon to carry the baskets home without looking into them [G561]. Cf. Type 1132. The youngest sister pretends to marry the demon and leaves a skull (straw dummy) dressed as a bride to deceive him. Unwittingly the demon carries this sister home in the third basket. Or she smears herself with honey and feathers and escapes as a strange bird [K525, K521.1]. Cf. Types 1383, 1681. The demon is burned in his own house or is killed in another way [Q211]. Cf. Type 312."
2100,311B*,The Singing Bag,"A Gypsy (old man) puts the niece of an old washerwoman (only daughter of an old couple) into a bag and carries her off. The Gypsy goes begging from door to door and exhibits his singing bag: He gives the bag a pinch, threatens to beat it with his stick, and orders it to sing. Thereupon the girl in the bag starts singing her tale: I left my rosary on a stone by the river when I was washing. When I wanted to get it, a Gypsy put me in his bag and carried me off. (I am the only daughter of an old couple. An old man carried me off when I was gathering berries in the forest.) One day the Gypsy arrives at the old washerwomans house. The woman recognizes her niece, invites the Gypsy into his house, and entertains him until he gets drunk. When he is sleeping, she rescues the girl from the bag and, in her place, puts two cats (horse-dung). When the Gypsy exhibits his singing bag the next time, the cats mew. The Gypsy opens the bag and is scratched or bitten [K526]."
2101,312,Maiden-killer (Bluebeard) (previously The Giant-killer and his Dog),"An odd-looking rich man (e.g. with a blue beard [S62.1]) takes his bride to his splendid castle. She is forbidden to open a certain room, but she disobeys and finds it full of the dead bodies of her predecessors [C611]. The husband wants to kill her for her disobedience [C920], but she is able to delay the punishment (three times) [K551]. She (her sister) calls their brother (three brothers) who kills the husband (sometimes with help from a dog or other animal) and rescues his sister(s) [G551.1, G652]. Cf. Type 311."
2102,312A,The Rescued Girl (previously The Brother Rescues His Sister from the Tiger),"A man gives his daughter in marriage to a tiger (monkey, supernatural being) because he made a rash vow (as a payment for the tigers help, or because the tiger threatened him). The tiger eats the girl and demands her sister(s), whom he also eats. The youngest sister (brother) kills the tiger (the girl escapes and the tiger is lured back to the village and killed)."
2103,312C,The Rescued Bride (previously Devils Bride Rescued by Brother),"(Including the previous Type 452A*.) (A man promises his daughter to the devil.) The girl marries the devil (Or: A youth curses his sister: The devil may take her. This happens.) The brother searches for his sister, finds her and rescues her (frequently with the help of his dogs)."
2104,312D,Rescue by the Brother (previously Brother Saves his Sister and Brothers from the Dragon),"(Peas Son.) A dragon (devil) carries off a girl (three girls) and kills her brothers when they try to rescue her. After a magic conception (often by swallowing a pea [T511.3]), the mother of the siblings gives birth to a strong son [F611.1]. This son kills the dragon, rescues his sister, and resuscitates his brothers. The envious brothers plan to kill the youngest. But because of his strength he is able to free himself and to punish his brothers. Cf. Type 550."
2105,313,The Magic Flight,"(Including the previous Types 313A, 313B, 313C, and 313H*.) This type combines various introductory episodes with the two main parts of the Magic Flight and the Forgotten Fiance. Introductory episodes: (1) After a war between birds and quadrupeds [B261, cf. Type 222], a wounded eagle is cared for by a man. The eagle (its relatives) gives the man a box which he must not open before he arrives at home. The man disobeys and a castle appears. An giant helps the man close the box and, in return, is promised the mans unborn son [S222]. Cf. Type 537. In some variants, a boy is promised to a demon, giant, or devil [S222, S240], or the boy promises himself to the demon. Threatening him with death, the demon (giant, devil) assigns the youth (often three) impossible tasks [G465] (e.g. building a castle in one night [H1104], bailing out a pond with a sieve [H1113], felling a forest using an axe of glass, capturing a magic horse [H1154.8]) which he performs with the help of the demons daughter [H335.0.1]. Before the youth can marry the daughter, he must identify her in a group of women (her sisters) who look just like her. (2) A youth watches girls (transformed swans) bathing in a lake and steals the swan dress of one of them [D361.1, D721]. The girl agrees to marry the youth and takes him to her fathers house. Cf. Types 400, 465A. (3) A king suffering from leprosy (scabs) captures a prince and feeds him with sweets for forty days, in the hope that the princes blood will cure his sickness. The princess falls in love with the foreign youth. Main parts: Magic Flight. The daughter of the demon (king) uses her magical power to flee together with the youth. She leaves magic speaking objects (spittle, blood) behind to deceive her father [D1611]. Nevertheless the flight is discovered and the father follows them. In order to escape, the girl transforms herself and her fianc into various things or persons (e.g. into rose and thornbush, church and priest, lake and duck) [D671], or she throws magic objects (comb, brush, mirror, etc.)which become obstacles in the way of the pursuer [D672]. After the third transformation, the pursuer has to give up (dies). Cf. Type 310. In some variants of the Magic Flight two children (brother and sister) flee from a witch (demon, dragon, ogre, witch, wolf, bad stepmother). (Previously Type 313H*.) Forgotten Fiance [D2003]. The youth goes to visit his home and leaves his bride behind. At home he breaks a taboo: Disobeying the brides warning, he kisses someone (eats something) and thus forgets his experiences [D2004.2, C234, D2004.3]. When the youth is about to marry another woman, the forgotten fiance reawakens his memory by performing magic actions (paralyses three lovers in embarrassing positions [D2006.1.1], magically stops the wedding carriage of the new bride [D2006.1.5], brings a couple of birds who remind the youth of her help [D2006.1.3], or buys a place for three nights in the bridal bed from her husbands new bride, and in the third night successfully reawakens his memory [D1978.4, D2006.1.4], etc.). The youth marries the true bride."
2106,313E*,The Sisters Flight (previously Girl Flees from Brother who Wants to Marry her),"A brother wants to marry his sister. (Cf. Type 510B.) She flees and arrives in the underworld at the house of a witch. There she meets the witchs daughter who resembles her. Both girls escape from the sorceress by a magic flight, throwing objects behind them. (Cf. Type 313.) The girls change into birds, and the brother is not able to distinguish them. He pretends he is going to kill himself. The sister betrays herself by an involuntary cry. The brother marries the sorceresss daughter."
2107,314,Goldener (previously The Youth Transformed to a Horse),"(Including the previous Type 532.) This type combines various introductory episodes with a common main part. Cf. Types 314A, 502, and 530. Introductory episodes: (1) A boy has been promised (often in return for magic conception) to a demon (devil, giant) [S211], or he voluntarily becomes a servant in a demons house [G462]. The demon orders him to care for two (groups of) animals, to feed the one and to neglect the other. The boy does not follow these instructions and thus makes friends with the abused animal (magic horse) [B316]. Against the prohibition of the demon, he enters a certain chamber [C611]. As a mark of disobedience, his hair turns gold [C912]. The boy and the magic horse escape from the demon by a magic flight [D672]. (2) A boy (usually the son of a ruler) and a magic foal are close friends. The mother (stepmother) wants to kill the boy. The magic foal warns the boy of her secret murderous attempts. At last the mother demands that the boy or the foal be killed. The boy pretends to agree but asks his father to be allowed to ride the foal one last time. During this ride the foal flies away together with the boy [B184.1.6]. (3) In return for his magic conception, a boy is promised to a demon [G461]. On the way to the demons house, the boy is forewarned (given instructions for how to kill the demon or to flee). In the rooms of the demons house, the boy finds prisoners or corpses (and his hair turns to gold [C912]). The boy kills the demon and flees. Main part: The youth covers his golden hair, pretending to be a scaldhead, and takes service in the kings court as a gardener [K1816.1]. (He says nothing except, I dont know. [C495.1]; previously Type 532). But the youngest princess sees him in his true form ( as a golden-haired knight who destroys and restores the garden three times) [H75.4]. She falls in love with Goldener [T91.6.4] and chooses him as her husband by throwing a golden apple to him [T55.1]. They marry but the angry king banishes the couple to a shabby lodging [L132, L113.1.0.1]. The king demands the help of his sons-in-law. Goldener has only a poor kit and is mocked. With the help of his magic horse he achieves various heroic deeds: He obtains the magic remedy (e.g. milk of a bird, water of life) for the king who had grown blind (cf. Type 551), kills a dragon (cf. Type 300), defeats a foreign army three times in disguise. He is wounded and is bandaged by the king. Three times he withdraws and is mocked as a fool. Cf. Type 530. Goldeners identity is revealed (e.g. by wounds, brands) and his true status is recognized [H55, H56]. The horse asks to be decapitated and becomes a prince (princess, other person)."
2108,314A,The Shepherd and the Three Giants,"A poor youth (orphan, fool, youngest of three brothers) sets out with his only heirloom (e.g. rusty sabre) or with magic objects (stick, flute, etc.)which grateful old people gave him [D817]. He becomes the kings shepherd [L113.1.4]. Cf. Types 570, 592. The youth is allowed to pasture his livestock on the kings land but not on the neighboring territory which belongs to three giants (because no one has ever returned from there). The youth disobeys and, with the help of his magic objects (strength), overcomes the three giants one after the other (sometimes their mother, too) [G500]. In the giants lodging the youth finds a magic horse [B184.1] and armour of three different metals (magic weapons, immeasurable wealth, helpful spirits, enchanted persons). The king promises his daughter to whoever rescues her from a (three) dragon(s) (cf. Type 300), wins a tournament (cf. Type 530), or helps him in battle (cf. Type 314). The youth, wearing his shining armour and riding his magic horse, succeeds three times. He withdraws and hides [R222] until the princess recognizes him as the true champion. The youth marries the princess and becomes king [L161]."
2109,314A*,Animal as Helper in the Flight (previously The Bullock-savior),"(Including the previous Type 314B*.) This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A bull (horse, moose, ox, bear, wolf, birds) helps children (another person) to escape from their pursuer (devil, witch, robbers). (2) The devil (white wolf) wants to abduct (marry) a princess (girl). A goat puts a straw sheaf in the place of the princess, asks the real princess to climb in a cart, covers her with hay, and tells the devil whom he meets on the way that the princess is at home. The devil grabs the sheaf and takes it to hell. The goat brings the girl home. (Previously Type 314B*.)"
2110,315,The Faithless Sister,"Brother and sister leave home (are driven out). The brother kills a number of robbers (devils, giants, dragons) but does not realize that the last one is merely wounded [F615]. The sister helps the wounded robber to recover, and he becomes her lover. In order to get rid of the brother, she pretends to be ill and sends him out to get her the milk (liver) of dangerous animals [K2212.0.2]. The brother spares the animals and they follow him (give him a whistle). After the first attempt fails, the sister binds her brother with a silk thread, or she sends him to a magic mill where the animals are kept. When the couple is about to kill the brother, he whistles for the animals. They (break out from the mill and) tear the robber to pieces. The faithless sister is imprisoned (has to repent and to fill a barrel with her tears). The brother takes to the road, rescues a princess from a dragon [R111.1.1], and marries her [L161]. Cf. Type 300. The sister is brought to the court. She tries to take revenge on her brother by putting a (poisoned) bone into his bed. The brother dies. The animals lick the bone out of his body and he revives. The sister is punished by death."
2111,315A,The Cannibal Sister,"A woman (queen) who has only sons gives birth to a daughter. The girl first devours the animals, then her brothers and parents, and finally the inhabitants of the village (city) [G30, G346]. Only one brother escapes. (Or: At a kings court every night someone devours horses. The elder princes who keep watch fail, but the youngest shoots the monster. He recognizes his baby sister as the cannibal because one of her fingers has been shot off. The youth is driven away [as a liar] or flees [sometimes together with his mother or elder sister].) The youth marries, gives his wife a life token, leaves his dogs (young lions, panther) behind, and returns home. He finds everything devastated. His sister devours his horse and threatens to devour him, too. While she is sharpening her teeth, the youth must play an instrument to prove he is still there. A mouse takes his place and he flees [B521]. The youth escapes and climbs three trees in succession which his sister gnaws down [R251]. Warned by the life token, his dogs come to save him and kill the cannibal sister [B524.1.2]."
2112,316,The Nix of the Mill-pond,"A poor fisherman (miller) (unwittingly) promises his son [S240] to a water nix [F420.1.2], who makes the fisherman wealthy. The parents keep the child away from the water. When the appointed time comes, the son learns about his fathers promise and flees. On the way the youth divides the carcass of an animal among a lion, a falcon, and an ant (other animals) by taking the animals characteristics into consideration. In return he receives from the grateful animals the power to transform himself into their shapes. Using this power he wins a princess as his wife. After winning a battle (while hunting) the youth comes near the water and is seized and pulled down (swallowed) by the water nix [F420.5.2.2]. By offering precious objects (three golden apples), his wife tempts the nix to the surface. In exchange for these objects the water nix exhibits her husband: first up to his head, then up to his waist. When the water nix exhibits the husbands whole body, he changes into a bird and escapes [R152, D642.2]."
2113,317,The Tree that Grows up to the Sky (previously The Stretching Tree),"(Including the previous Type 468.) In a kings yard a tree grows up to the sky [F54.1]. A dragon (giant) living in the tree carries off the princess. The king promises her as a wife to whoever can bring her back. In some variants, the king promises his daughter to whoever brings him healing fruits from the tree. After noble canditates have failed, a young swineherd succeeds in climbing the tree wearing iron boots [Q502.2]. In the upper world the youth guards the dragons magic horse which tells him (he asks the princess to find out) where the dragons power is hidden. The youth kills the dragon, returns to earth together with the princess, and marries her. In some variants, in the upper world the youth watches over the magic horses of a fairy (Tndr Ilona) who gives him clothes of copper, silver, and gold. The fairy falls in love and marries the youth. The youth enters a forbidden chamber [C611] and frees a dragon which carries off the fairy. Continuation as in Type 302C*."
2114,318,The Faithless Wife,"(Including the previous Type 590A.) Introduction: Two brothers live together. The younger works for the elder, who is married. The wife attempts to seduce the younger brother but he refuses her. She complains to her husband that her brother-in-law attacked her [K2111]. The youth flees from his angry brother. In some variants, this part continues as follows: The fugitive is caught and castrated. After this he lives in a foreign city. A princess falls in love with him and marries him in spite of his mutilation. When the king learns of his son-in-laws defect, the latter has to flee. He is cured by a supernatural being and is able to return to his wife. Main part: A youth acquires magic objects, among them a magic gift (rusty sword, shirt that imparts strength) from a serpent which he rescued (by theft, by other means). Using these objects, he helps a king to be victorious and, in return, marries a princess. The princess has a lover [T232]. She persuades her husband to give her the magic objects (exchanges them) [K2213]. The husband is killed and, as he had requested, his dismembered body is loaded on his horse and carried to the serpents castle. The dead youth is resuscitated (by the serpent) and given the power of self-transformation. As a horse with a golden mane he is sold to the king. The princess recognizes the horse as her former husband and orders that it be killed. (On his advice) a maidservant catches drops of its blood which turn into a tree with golden apples. The princess recognizes the tree as her former husband, and orders that it be felled. (On his advice) the maidservant throws a chip into a pond, where it turns into a golden drake [D610]. The lover, leaving the sword and shirt behind, tries to catch the drake. The drake becomes a man and uses his magic power to kill his rival and his treacherous wife. He marries the maidservant."
2115,321,Eyes Recovered from Witch,"A youth takes service as a herdsman with a blind man (couple) whose eyes have been stolen by one or more dragon(s) (giant, witch, fairy). The youth is warned not to take his flock to pasture beyond a certain point, but he disobeys. He meets a dragon and defeats it or tricks it. He retrieves the stolen eyes [D2161.3.1.1] or receives a magic remedy which enables him to cure the blind man."
2116,322*,Magnetic Mountain Draws Everything to It,"A kings ship is drawn to a magnetic mountain and smashed to pieces, and the king is washed ashore unconscious [F754]. Advised in a dream [D1814.2, F1068], the king finds a copper bow [D1091] with three lead arrows [D1092]. As instructed he climbs the mountain without looking back [C331] or speaking [C400] and shoots a copper rider off a copper horse in a temple with copper pillars. The rider falls into the sea, and the king buries the horse. The magnetic mountain begins to sink. A copper man arrives in a copper boat and rescues the king at the last moment. In some variants, the rescuer is a giant bird."
2117,325,The Magician and his Pupil,"A father apprentices his son to a magician [D1711.0.1]. In order for the son to be released at the end of the apprenticeship, the father has to recognize him [H62.1, H161]. The youth secretly learns how to practice magic and flees, or his father identifies him among a flock of identical doves (other birds) with the help of tokens which the son (an old man) had given to him. The son is released. The father sells the youth successively as a greyhound, an ox, and a horse, but the son tells him not to sell the things that bind them (leash, yoke, bridle). Thus father and son become wealthy [D612, K252]. But at last the youth as a horse returns to the magicians influence because, contrary to instructions, the father let the magician take the bridle. So the youth loses his power and is tormented by the magician [C837]. Finally the youth succeeds in removing the bridle. He conquers the magician in a transformation combat (they change themselves into hare, fish, bird, etc.)and escapes [D722, D615.2]. At last, transformed into a ring (apple, etc.), he falls into a princesss lap. When the magician asks for the ring, the princess throws it away and grains of corn fall on the ground.

2118,325*,The Sorcerers Apprentice (previously Apprentice and Ghost),"A sorcerers apprentice who reads a verse from a forbidden book calls up a spirit, but cannot make him go away. When the sorcerer reads the verse backwards, the spirit disappears."
2119,325**,Sorcerer Punished,A sorcerer who committed evil deeds (e.g. killed a farmers sheep) is punished by another sorcerer (e.g. he is bewitched and grows a tail).
2120,326,The Youth Who Wanted to Learn What Fear Is,"A youth (fool) who does not know what fear is goes to find it [H1376.2]. He tries various frightening experiences without becoming afraid [H1400]: He is shaved by a barber-ghost [E571], spends the night under a gallows [H1415] or in a haunted castle [E281], plays with dead persons (bowling [E577.3], cards [E577.2]), etc. Through his fearless behavior he disenchants a castle (wins a treasure, a promised princess) [Q82]. The youth finally learns what fear is when cold water is thrown on him [H1441], fishes are put into his bed while he is asleep [H1441.1], birds fly into his face, his cut-off head is put on backwards, etc. Sometimes sexual: he finds a woman in his bed."
2121,326A*,Soul Released from Torment,"A poor soldier spends a night in a haunted house to earn a reward.

2123,327,The Children and the Ogre,"This type refers to a cycle of related tales. It combines episodes from types 327A, 327B, and 327C."
2124,327A,Hansel and Gretel,"A (poor) father (persuaded by the stepmother) abandons his children (a boy and a girl) in the forest [S321, S143]. Twice the children find their way back home, following scattered pebbles [R135]. On the third night, birds eat the scattered peas (bread-crumbs) [R135.1]. The children come upon a gingerbread house which belongs to a witch (ogress) [G401, F771.1.10, G412.1]. She takes them into her house. The boy is fattened [G82], while the girl must do housework. The witch asks the boy to show his finger in order to test how fat he is [G82.1], but he shows her a bone (stick) [G82.1.1]. When the witch wants to cook the boy, the sister deceives her by feigning ignorance and pushes her into the oven [G526, G512.3.2]. (The witchs son finds out that his mother has been killed and pursues the children.) The children escape, carrying the witchs treasure with them. Birds and beasts (angels) help them across water. They return home. Cf. Type 327."
2125,327B,The Brothers and the Ogre (previously The Dwarf and the Giant),"Seven (three, twelve, thirty) brothers come to an ogres house, where they are given night lodging. The ogre intends to cut off the brotherss heads. In order to recognize his own daughters, the ogre gives them nightcaps (head-scarves). One brother (often the youngest, Thumbling) detects the plan, and all brothers put on the nightcaps of the ogres daughters (exchange their caps for the daughters head-scarves, change sleeping-places with the daughters). In the night, the ogre cuts off his own daughters heads by mistake [K1611]. The brothers escape. Cf. Types 327, 1119."
2126,327C,The Devil (Witch) Carries the Hero Home in a Sack,"A witch (ogre) entices a boy (conceived by magic, Thumbling) into her bag and carries him away (from his home). By deceiving the witch (putting stones, thorns, mud, etc. in his place), the boy is able to escape twice from the bag. The third time, the witch carries him to her home. He is to be killed by the witchs daughter. The boy tricks the daughter (by making her show him how he should prepare to be killed [G526]), throws her into a pot (burns her in the oven), and serves her as a meal to her family [G61]. He taunts the witch, kills her, and returns home (sometimes with the witchs treasure)."
2127,327D,The Kiddelkaddelkar,"A boy and a girl lose their way in a forest and come to the house of an ogre. The wife protects the children, but the ogre discovers them and intends to hang them. The girl persuades the ogre to show them how it is done. Hanging himself, the ogre begs to be released and promises the children his kiddelkaddelkar, a magic cart pulled by (golden) bucks, and much treasure. The children flee and on the way ask three men not to reveal their route. The third man is so much frightened by the ogre that he betrays the children, who hide in a cave. The ogre, not suspecting the childrens presence, lies down to sleep and blocks the way out. The children kill him but cannot leave the cave for three nights until a giant bird eats the ogres corpse. Then they return to their parents with the ogres treasure."
2128,327F,The Witch and the Fisher Boy,"By imitating the words and voice of his mother who brings him food to the shore each day, a witch tries to catch a fisher boy. She succeeds after she has her tongue made thin by a smith [F556.2, K1832], and carries the boy to her home. When the witchs daughter tries to bake the boy, he pushes her into the oven [G526, G512.3.2]. The boy hides in a tree and tells the witch that she has eaten her own daughter (witch finds the daughters ring or hair). He is discovered. The witch fells the tree, but at the last moment birds rescue the boy (he makes wings for himself), and he flies home (the witch is trampled by animals, or she bursts while trying to drink the boys image reflected in the water)."
2129,327G,The Brothers at the Witchs House (previously The Boy at the Devils [Witchs] House),"A witch (devil) catches three brothers one of them a fool and fattens them. Her youngest daughter is to roast one of them. The fool pretends he does not know how to lie on the bread paddle and roasts the daughter, whom the old witch eats unwittingly.

2130,328,The Boy Steals the Ogres Treasure,"(Corvetto). Introduction (sometimes missing): Three (twelve, thirteen, thirty, etc.)brothers arrive at the house of an ogre (devil). He would kill them in the night, but the smart youngest brother saves them by exchanging their caps with those of the ogres daughters. (Cf. Types 327B, 1119.) The brothers take service at the kings court. Main part: The jealous brothers claim that the youngest can steal the ogres treasures [H1151, H911]: magic horse [H1151.9], bedspread, carpet, parrot (lamp, sword [D1400.1.4.1], silver or golden poultry, musical instruments [D1233], etc.). Using tricks the youth gets these objects. Cf. Types 1525, 1525A. At last the brothers claim that the youngest can kidnap the ogre himself [H1172]. In disguise the youth tells the ogre that the thief died and persuades him to lie down in the coffin to measure it [G514.1]. The youth nails up the coffin, traps the ogre, and is given a princess as his wife. In some variants, the youth sets out to steal from the ogre in order to get revenge for former ill-treatment [G610.1] or to help a friendly king [G610.3]. In some variants, mainly from northern and north-western Europe and the Americas, the protagonist is female."
2131,328*,Three Giants with One Eye (previously A Boy Guards the Kings Garden),Two brothers lose their way in a forest (a son leaves his parents house and takes a rest while walking through a forest). They are threatened by three giants (trolls) who share only one eye which they put by turns into their foreheads [G121.1]. The brothers steal the giantseye [G612] and give it back in exchange for a rich reward of gold and silver (magic gifts).
2132,328A,Jack and the Beanstalk,"A poor boy named Jack trades his cow for some beans (his mother finds a bean while sweeping the house). One of the beans grows into a giant beanstalk [F54.2], which Jack climbs to an upper world where he finds the house of a giant. The giants wife gives him food and hides him when her husband comes home. The giant smells human flesh [G84] but his wife tells him he is mistaken [G532]. The giant eats dinner, counts his money, and then falls asleep. Jack steals the money and runs home down the beanstalk. He makes two more trips, stealing the giants hen that lays golden eggs [B103.2.1] and his self-playing harp [D1601.18]. The third time, the harp cries out and awakens the giant, who runs after Jack. Jack reaches the bottom of the beanstalk and chops it down. The giant falls to his death, and Jack and his mother have plenty of money."
2133,328A*,"Three Brothers Steal Back the Sun, Moon, and Star","Three brothers go out to retrieve the sun, the moon, and the stars which were stolen by three multi-headed dragons (devils). One of the brothers (often the son of a she-dog) defeats the dragons and releases the celestial lights. Cf. Type 300A."
2134,329,Hiding from the Princess (previously Hiding from the Devil),"A princess promises to marry whoever can hide himself so well that she cannot find him [H321]. Those who fail are beheaded (heads are displayed on stakes) [H901.1]. A (poor) youth (youngest of three brothers) undertakes the task. Because he had helped some animals (an old man), a fish hides him in his belly, an eagle behind the clouds (the sun), and a fox under the earth [D684, H982]. The princess finds him with her magic mirror (magic book) or her perfect sight. The princess gives the youth a fourth trial: He hides behind the magic mirror (under the princesss seat) or transforms himself (is transformed) and sits as a louse (sticks as a rose) in her hair, etc. [D641]. The princess cannot find him, so she grants his superiority and marries him."
2135,330,The Smith and the Devil (previously The Smith Outwits the Devil),"(Bonhomme Misre.) (Including the previous Types 330AD and 330*.) A smith, who because of poverty (other reasons) sold his soul to the devil (death) [M211], gives shelter to Christ and St. Peter during their visit on earth [K1811]. In reward, three of his wishes shall be fulfilled [Q115] (cf. Type 750A). St. Peter warns him to wish for a place in paradise, but the smith wants a tree and a bench (chair) to which people stick and a knapsack that draws people into it [J2071, D1413.1, D1413.5, D1412.1] (a pack of cards with which he shall always win [N221], etc.). Cf. Type 753A. When the devil (death) is about to carry the smith away, he sticks to the bench and the tree and has to give the smith more time to live (terminate the contract), or no one would be able to die [Z111.2]. At last the devil is put into the sack and beaten up (on the anvil) [K213]. The smith, tired of life, cannot go either to heaven or to hell [Q565]. He tricks St. Peter by pushing his knapsack into heaven, where it pulls him in [K2371.1.3] (throws his cards inside the gate of heaven and is permitted inside to pick them up). In some variants the trickster-protagonist is an allegorical figure (e.g. Misery, Envy, Poverty) who traps the devil in a tree until the devil promises him immortality. Then he sets the devil free. (Previously Type 330D.)"
2136,331,The Spirit in the Bottle,"A man (son of a woodcutter, smith, fisherman, soldier) frees an evil spirit from a vessel (bottle) out of curiosity (because he was asked by the spirit) [R181]. The spirit (which stretches out to an enormous height,) wants to take revenge for being locked for so long, and threatens to kill his rescuer. The man tricks the spirit: He pretends he does not believe that the spirit could grow small again and thus induces him to go back into the vessel [K717]. The man stoppers the bottle and the spirit is trapped. In some variants, he is released again in return for a gift (wonderful remedy, magic power [D1240, D2102]). Cf. Types 155, 735A."
2137,332,Godfather Death,"(Including the previous Types 332A* and 332B*.) A poor man with many children wants a (just) godfather for his newborn son. He refuses God (saint, devil) and chooses death (angel of death, plague) because he treats everyone alike [Z111, J486]. As a gift the father (son) receives the magic power of forecasting recovery or death, depending on whether death stands at the head or the foot of the sick persons bed [D1825.3.1]. Thus the man becomes a famous doctor and grows wealthy. The doctor betrays death (several times): When promised wealth (the princess), the doctor turns the bed and thus saves the life of a person who was supposed to die [K557] (in the doctors dying hour, death grants him time to say a last Paternoster, but the doctor does not finish the prayer [K551.1] cf. Type 1199. Death tricks the doctor into finishing the prayer.) In some variants, death shows the man his life-light in the underworld and suddenly extinguishes it [E765.1.3, K551.9]. Or the man attempts to lengthen his life by various means (usually without success). (Previously Type 332A*.) Cf. Type 1187."
2138,332C*,Immortality Won through Betrayal of Death,"This tale exists in two different forms: (1) An old soldier becomes the doorkeeper for heaven. Death asks him several times whom he should take next. God wants death to take the old people (then people in the middle of their life, then young people in succession). However, the doorkeeper wants to save his parents (wife, children), so he tells death instead to fell firs (beech-trees, oaks). God discovers this deception and shows death whom he should take next. Thus the soldier and his relatives are reunited in heaven. (In some variants, the soldier is banished to hell. Here he delivers a number of souls from purgatory and is chased away. Cf. Type 475.) (2) A prince wants to gain immortality. He travels through three different kingdoms, in which the rulers have to perform tasks which must be finished within 600 (800, 1000) years (pulling out a tree, carrying off a mountain, wearing out thousands of sewing needles). During this time death has lost his power. Each time the prince is given magic objects and asked to stay, but he travels on. Finally he arrives at the empire of immortality. After a thousand years he goes to look for his parents. The queen of immortality gives him water of life which he uses to resuscitate the deceased rulers of the three kingdoms. The prince, finding no trace of his former home and family, returns. Pursued by death, he reaches the border of the empire of immortality. In a contest with death, the queen of immortality wins the prince and they live together forever."
2139,333,Little Red Riding Hood (previously The Glutton),"(Petit Chaperon Rouge, Cappuccetto rosso, Rotkppchen.) (Including the previous Type 333A.) A little girl, called Red Riding Hood because of her red cap, is sent to her grandmother who lives in the forest and is warned not to leave the path [J21.5]. On the way she meets a wolf. The wolf learns where the girl is going, hurries on ahead, and devours the grandmother (puts her blood in a glass and her flesh in a pot). He puts on her clothes and lies down in her bed. Red Riding Hood arrives at the grandmothers house. (She has to drink the blood, eat the flesh, and lie down in the bed.) Red Riding Hood doubts whether the wolf is her grandmother and asks him about his odd big ears [Z18.1], eyes, hands, and mouth. Finally the wolf eats Red Riding Hood [K2011]. A hunter kills the wolf and cuts open his belly. Red Riding Hood and the grandmother are rescued alive [F913]. They fill the wolfs belly with stones [Q426]; he is drowned or falls to his death. Cf. Types 123, 2028. In some variants Red Riding Hood arrives at the grandmothers house before the wolf. The wolf climbs on the roof to wait until Red Riding Hood leaves. The Grandmother who had boiled sausages asks Red Riding Hood to fill the broth into a big trough in front of the house. Enticed by the smell, the wolf falls from the roof and is drowned in the trough. In an Italian version, a woman who is going to bake cakes sends out her daughter (Caterinella, Caterina, Cattarinetta) to borrow a pan. The lender, an ogre (witch, wolf), asks the girl to bring back some cakes and wine. On her way she eats the cakes, drinks the wine, and replaces them with horse-dung and urine. Angry about the trick, the ogre pursues the girl home and devours her (is not able to get into the house, is tricked out by the girls mother). (Previously Type 333A.)"
2140,334,Household of the Witch,"(Including the previous Type 333B.) A girl (woman) disregards the warning of friendly animals (parts of her body) and visits her godmother (grandmother) who is a cannibal. The girl sees many gruesome things (e.g. fence of bones, barrel full of blood, and her godmother with an animals head). When the girl tells her godmother what she has seen she is killed (devoured). Cf. Type 363."
2141,335,Deaths Messengers,"Death promises to warn a certain man before he comes to him, so the man lives happily. When death finally comes to take him, the man accuses him not having kept his promise. Death replies that he warned him with the illnesses and infirmities of old age, and takes the man away [J1051]."
2142,360,Bargain of the Three Brothers with the Devil,"Three traveling journeymen (brothers, friends) conclude an agreement with the devil: They receive a large amount of money (purse which will never be empty) on the condition that they pledge themselves always to say the same words, we three, for gold, that was right [C495.2.1, M175]. The host of an inn kills a rich merchant and accuses the journeymen. Because of their stereotyped answers they seem to confess the offence. Cf. Type 1697. The devil rescues them from the gallows [R175]. The host is hanged in their place, and the devil is satisfied to take his soul and leave the journeymen alone [K217]."
2143,361,Bear-skin,"A poor soldier sells his soul to the devil for an immense amount of money (a purse which will never be empty) [M211]. The soldiers soul will be released after he has lived for seven years without washing or combing himself [C721.1, C723.1]. The soldier helps a poor man, who agrees to let him marry one of his daughters. The two elder daughters scoff at the dirty man, but the youngest daughter agrees to marry him [L54.1]. The soldier leaves her a token (half of a ring or coin). After seven years the bargain is completed. The devil washes and dresses the soldier, and releases him. He returns to his bride as a rich gentleman and is recognized by the token. The envious elder sisters commit suicide. Thus instead of one soul the devil gets two (sometimes more) [K217]. Cf. Type 475."
2144,361*,The Wolf with an Iron Head (previously Wolf Threatens to Eat Hero),"A wolf with an iron head helps a poor man (shepherd) in distress and demands that he should not marry (threatens to eat the man and is put off until his wedding day). On the wedding day, the wolf appears again, the man flees and, after a number of adventures, finally kills the wolf with help of his dogs."
2145,362*,The Devils Kindness,The devil helps a poor man with his work (gives a poor man the treasure of a rich couple). A second man (couple) hangs himself out of envy (grief) and thus the devil receives his payment [K217].
2146,363,The Corpse-Eater (previously The Vampire),"A young woman wants to marry a man with an unusual feature (green beard, golden nose, etc.). A demonic bridegroom with these characteristics appears, and she follows him to his far-away castle. On the way she watches him eating corpses in three churches (graveyards) [G20]. Cf. Type 894. The bridegroom asks her whether she has seen anything. She says no, even when he appears in the form of her father and brother [D40, D610]. Finally, in the form of her mother, he asks her and she confesses. She is devoured (is able to flee at the last moment). Cf. Type 334."
2147,365,The Dead Bridegroom Carries Off his Bride,"(Lenore). (Including the previous Type 365A*.) A young woman mourns for her bridegroom who did not return from war (brings him back to life by magic). One night he appears, invites her to ride with him, and carries her behind on his horse. Two times he asks her whether she is afraid. She says no because her lover is with her. The third time they arrive at a graveyard. When the bridegroom wants to entice her into an open grave, she realizes that he is dead. He grasps at her and tears her clothing. The bride escapes (is pulled into the grave [E215], danced to death by the dancing dead, or torn to pieces)."
2148,366,The Man from the Gallows,"This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A man (woman, child) takes the liver (lung, heart, stomach, backside) of a corpse who has been hanged (other dead person). At home the meat is eaten (often without knowing what it is [G60]). At night the dead person appears, asks for the stolen part of his body, and punishes the perpetrator (eater) by carrying him away (to hell) or by killing him [E235.4]. (2) A child (adult person) who has lost a leg (arm) wears a golden (diamond) one as a substitute. The child dies, and the parents (servants, grave-diggers, etc.)take the golden leg. At night the dead child appears, complains about the loss of his leg [E235.4.1, E235.4.2], and receives it back."
2149,368C*,The Death of the Cruel Stepmother,"A cruel stepmother sends her stepdaughter in March to the river to wash wool. Two travelers, Christ (God) and St. Peter, help the girl, and she brings back a flower. Thus the evil stepmother thinks that spring has already begun. She drives her flock of sheep into the mountains and freezes to stone."
2150,369,The Youth on a Quest for his Lost Father,"A boy (young man) sets out to find his father who went away (disappeared) before his birth [H1381.2.2.1]. He comes to the house of an old woman (witch) and tricks her (kills her, wins a contest with her son). He finds his father (alive, dead, or transformed into an animal). The boy (a god) releases (resuscitates) his father."
2151,500,The Name of the Supernatural Helper,"(e.g. Tom Tit Tot, Rumpelstilzchen, Trillevip.) A father (mother) boasts that his daughter can spin gold or impossible amounts of yarn. Or, a mother beats her daughter because she is lazy. The king asks why and the mother says she will not stop spinning [H914]. The young womans talent is to be tested and she is shut in a room to spin [H1021.8, H1092]. If she fails she will die, but if she succeeds the king will marry her. She cries. A supernatural being (a little man) agrees to help her [D2183] if she will promise him her first child (herself) if she cannot guess his name [H521, S222, S222.1]. In some variants she has to remember his name after a long time. The young woman passes the test and the king marries her. After a year the little man, certain that she could not guess his name, comes back to take her child away. By chance the name is discovered (by a servant, the husband or the woman herself) when the little man sings it triumphantly in the forest [N475]. When the woman says the correct name to the helper he vanishes or sinks into the earth [C432.1]."
2152,500*,The Monster Reveals the Riddle,Students must count the peaks of a mountain range. They go to sleep. A monster watches them and thinks they are a multi-headed monster. He says that he walked through all the peaks of the mountain range (naming the number) and had never seen such a strange thing. Thus the students hear and solve the riddle. Cf. Type 1091.
2153,501,The Three Old Spinning Women (previously The Three Old Women Helpers),"Through a false boast of her mother [H914] or of a young woman herself [H915], she is compelled to spin an impossible amount of thread [H1092]. If she is successful a prince will marry her. She receives help from three old women who are deformed from too much spinning: the first has an enormous foot, the second has drooping lips, and the third has a thick thumb [G201.1, G244, D2183]. In payment she must invite them to her wedding. The prince sees them and exclaims in disgust. They tell him that their deformities come from spinning. He swears that he will never let his wife spin again."
2154,502,The Wild Man,"A king catches a wild man (Iron John) and puts him into a cage, forbidding anyone to set him free. His son frees the prisoner because his ball rolls into the cage or because he feels pity for him. The prince is afraid of his fathers anger and leaves home (his father drives him away to be killed or sends him to another king) along with a servant. On their way the servant persuades the prince to exchange clothes. The prince becomes a servant at the court of another king. At a tournament he appears unrecognized three times on a splendid horse [R222] which he received from the wild man and wins the hand of a princess. Or, he wins the princess because he has helped her father in war [L161]. Often the wild man is disenchanted [G671]. In some variants the prince works for a while at the wild mans house where he disobeys instructions (e.g. looks into a forbidden chamber [C611], cares for a horse although it is not allowed [B316]) and his hair turns to gold. Cf. Type 314."
2155,503,The Gifts of the Little People,"A hunchbacked man takes part in a dance of the witches or people from below the earth (elves, fairies, dwarfs) [F331.1]. He sings their song or adds a missing rhyme or more weekdays [F331.3, F331.4]. As a reward they remove his hump [F344.1] or give him gold [F342.1]. A greedy neighbor (hunchbacked person) wants to get the same reward, but he ruins the song or is unfriendly. The little people add the hump of the other man to his own, or give him coals instead of gold [J2415]. Cf. Type 480D*."
2156,505,The Grateful Dead,"(Including the previous Types 506506B, 506**, and 508.) One introductory episode is combined with various main parts in which a man wins a princess and a castle. The ending is also very similar. Introductory episode: While traveling, a man sees a corpse which is not allowed to be buried or is ill-treated by its creditors [Q271.1]. He uses all his money to pay the debts of the dead man and for his funeral. Later he meets the grateful dead man in the form of a traveling companion (old man, servant) who wants to help him [E341] on the condition that they will divide all their winnings [M241]. Cf. Type 507. Main parts: (1) The man ransoms a princess, who had been kidnapped, from slavery and marries her [R111.1.6, L161]. While the man is away in another country, the father of the princess recognizes the sail of the ship which is emboidered with the princess coat of arms and learns that his daughter is alive. When the man goes back to fetch his wife, he finds that she has been abducted by one of her fathers courtiers. The man searches for his wife, and the traveling companion helps him to return to his father-in-laws court [R163]. There the man discloses his identity as the husband of the princess and gets his bride back. (Previously Type 506A.) (2) The man rescues a young woman from robbers. On their way home by ship the man is thrown overboard by a rival [S142] but is rescued by the traveling companion [R163] and brought to the princess. He is recognized by means of a ring or otherwise [H94.4, H11.1]. The rival is unmasked and punished. (Previously Type 506B.) (3) The traveling companion equips the man with a magnificent horse. A tournament takes place in which the winner is to marry a princess [H972, H331.2]. The man wins her. (Previously Type 508.) Ending: The traveling companion asks for his part of the winnings and wants to divide the princess (their baby) [M241.1]. When the man, trying to save the princess, offers the whole kingdom, the traveling companion reveals himself as the grateful dead man, says his demand was only a test of faith, and vanishes. In some variants the grateful dead man is a saint, who helps the hero because he has redeemed a saints picture that was mistreated [N848.1]. (Previously Type 506**.)"
2157,506*,Prophecy Escaped,"A child is born in answer to a prayer [T548.1]. It is foreseen to the child that it will die by hanging when he is 20 years old [M341.1.4]. The child is helped by a companion (saint) who favours him because of his modesty. The companion saves the childs life and wins a princess for him. The helper demands half of the winnings, so the princess is to be divided [M241.1]. Cf. Type 934."
2158,507,The Monsters Bride,"(Including the previous Types 507A507C.) This type consists of one introductory part and two different main parts. The ending is often the same. Introductory part: While traveling a young man provides a suitable funeral for an unknown man whose corpse was mistreated by creditors [Q271.1]. Later he meets a traveling companion (servant) who wants to help him [E341] on the condition that they will divide all their winnings [M241]. Cf. Type 505. On their way, the traveling companion obtains (three) magic objects (e.g. boots, magic hood, cloak, sabre, feather). The young man woos a princess who is in love with a magician (ogre, devil). Her suitors have to guess her thoughts three times (bring hidden objects [H322.1], solve difficult tasks). If they fail they are executed. Main part: (1) With the help of the magic objects, the companion of the young man becomes invisible and follows the princess on her way to the magician. There he finds the solutions [H972]. He frees the princess by beating, burning, or killing the magician [T172.2.1]. On the wedding night the young man has to submerge the princess (in different forms) three times in a bath to release her from her enchantment [D766.1]. (Previously Type 507A.) Cf. Type 306. (2) All bridegrooms of a princess have perished during the bridal night [T172.0.1]. The young man marries her on advice of his companion. A snake (snakes) comes into the chamber or crawls out of the princess mouth to kill the young man, but the companion kills it. (Previously Types 507B, 507C.) Cf. Types 840, 1145. Ending: (After a year) the companion demands his half of the winnings and divides the princess in two parts. Snakes crawl out of her body. He puts the halves together and the princess is disenchanted forever. In a few variants the companion only pretents to divide the princess [M241.1] to test the faith of the young man, and then discloses his identity as the grateful dead man. Cf. Type 505."
2159,510,Cinderella and Peau dne,This type number refers to a cycle of related tales. See esp. Types 510A and 510B.
2160,510A,Cinderella,"(Cenerentola, Cendrillon, Aschenputtel.) A young woman is mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters [S31, L55] and has to live in the ashes as a servant. When the sisters and the stepmother go to a ball (church), they give Cinderella an impossible task (e.g. sorting peas from ashes), which she accomplishes with the help of birds [B450]. She obtains beautiful clothing from a supernatural being [D1050.1, N815] or a tree that grows on the grave of her deceased mother [D815.1, D842.1, E323.2] and goes unknown to the ball. A prince falls in love with her [N711.6, N711.4], but she has to leave the ball early [C761.3]. The same thing happens on the next evening, but on the third evening, she loses one of her shoes [R221, F823.2]. The prince will marry only the woman whom the shoe fits [H36.1]. The stepsisters cut pieces off their feet in order to make them fit into the shoe [K1911.3.3.1], but a bird calls attention to this deceit. Cinderella who had been first hidden from the prince, tries on the shoe and it fits her. The prince marries her."
2161,510B,"Peau dasne (previously The Dress of Gold, of Silver, and of Stars [Cap o Rushes])","(Cap oRushes, Donkey Skin, All Kinds of Fur, Allerleirauh.) A king promises his wife on her deathbed [M255] only to marry another woman who is as beautiful as she is (whom a particular ring fits). Because she is the only one who meets this condition, the king wants to marry his grown daughter. In order to delay the wedding, the young woman asks him to give her dresses like the sun (gold), the moon (silver), and stars (diamonds), and a coat made of many different kinds of fur (a covering of wood). After he provides all these, the daughter runs away from her father [T311.1] and, disguised in the ugly skin [K521.1, F821.1.3, F821.1.4], works as a kitchen maid (goose-girl) in another castle. Cf. Types 706, 706C. When a series of feasts is held in the castle where she works, the young woman secretly puts on her splendid dresses. The prince falls in love with her [N711.6] but does not recognize her as the kitchen maid [R255]. On the following days he treats the kitchen maid badly. During the feasts he asks the beautiful woman where she comes from, and she gives cryptic answers that refer to how he had treated the kitchen maid [H151.5]. He gives her a ring. Then the prince becomes lovesick. In her character as kitchen maid, she slips his ring into his soup (bread). He finds her [H94.2, H94.4] and marries her. Sometimes the young woman is discovered while she is bathing or dressing instead of being recognized through a token."
2162,510B*,The Princess in the Chest,"A widowed king wants to marry his daughter. She demands that he give her a magic golden chest (golden lantern). On their wedding day, she hides herself in the chest. The father sells the chest to a prince (it is cast into the sea, where a prince finds it and brings it into his house). When the princess secretly comes out and eats his food, he discovers her and falls in love with her. The princes fiance discovers the princess and sends her away. The prince becomes lovesick and the princess brings him food in which she has hidden a ring of the prince. He finds her and marries her."
2163,511,"One-Eye, Two-Eyes, Three-Eyes","(Including the previous Types 452C*, 511A, and 511A*.) A girl (boy) has a stepmother who does not give her enough to eat but makes her herd cattle and spin a great amount of flax. She tells her sorrows to a (little colored) cow (red ox, godmother), who gives her food [B535.0.1] and helps her with her work. The stepmother wants to know why the girl is so well fed, and sends her one-, two- and three-eyed daughters one after the other to find out. The girl sings One-Eye [F512.1] and Two-Eyes to sleep, so they learn nothing, but she forgets to sing to the third eye of Three-Eyes [F512.2.1.1], who tells her mother about the cow [D830.1]. The stepmother determines to have the cow slaughtered. When the girl tells the animal this, the cow tells her to plant its bones (intestines, or not to eat its meat). She does as she was told, and a tree (apple tree) grows which continues to help her [B100.1, D1461, D1470.2]. A rich man notices the tree and asks for an apple. When the stepsisters try to pick one, a branch scratches them. Only the girl herself can pick the fruit [D590, H31.12], and the rich man marries her [L162]. Often the tree goes (is taken) with them. The stepmother and stepsisters are punished. Sometimes, the child and the cow run away when the stepsister discovers their secret. They pass through brass, silver, and gold forests [F811.1]. In each forest, the cow warns the child not to pick the leaves [C513], but the child disobeys. A brass etc. ox (wolf, lion) comes and fights with the cow of the child. The last of these overcomes the cow, which, before it dies, tells the child to save (plant) some part of its body (horn, hoof, skin) because it will help him later [B505, B115]. (Previously Type 511A.) Or, the cow dies after the escape and turns into an angel that flies to heaven. (Previously Type 511A*.) In some variants another woman wants to marry the girls father. She promises to take good care of the girl and convinces her to kill her mother by having her look into a chest and dropping the lid on her neck. Cf. Type 720. In other variants, after the stepmother discovers the secret of the cow, she tries to kill the girl in a covered pit filled with burning coals. A dog warns the girl in front of the pit. The stepmother kills the dog and the next day the girl falls into the pit. She is burned up, the cow licks the ashes, and a duck comes out. When her brother comes home, the girl in the form of this duck tells him what happened. He punishes the stepmother. (Previously Type 452C*.)"
2164,513,The Extraordinary Companions,This type number refers to a cycle of related tales. See esp. Types 513A513B.
2165,513A,Six Go through the Whole World,"A discharged soldier (fool) acquires many (six) traveling companions with extraordinary abilities [F601]: e.g. one who runs fast [F681.1], one who eats great quantities [F632, F633], one who produces (can withstand) severe frost [D2144.1.2], one who can shoot and hit the left eye of a fly from far away [F661.5.3], one with acute hearing [F641.1, F641.2, F641.3], one who can make himself taller, and one who can rip up trees by their roots [F621]. In order to avenge himself on the king who discharged him, the soldier enters a contest to marry the princess [H331]. She has agreed to marry anyone who beats her at running [H331.5.1]. The king permits the soldier to employ his helpers. The runner overtakes the princess, but he falls asleep and is awakened just in time by the sharpshooter. In an effort to prevent the wedding, the king assigns other tasks: eating (drinking) a huge quantity [H1114, H1142], which the eater accomplishes, and staying in an oven [H1511], which the freezing man accomplishes. Finally the king offers the soldier as much money as he and his companions can carry [cf. H1127] if he will give up his claim for the princess. The companions ruin the king and overcome his army. The same motifs appear together in a reduced form. A prince (young man) is looking for a wife. He takes as servants men who help him accomplish tasks that have been set for suitors who hope to marry the princess [F605.2]. In the end he marries her [L161]."
2166,513B,The Land and Water Ship,"A king offers his daughter in marriage [H335, H331] to whoever can build a ship that can travel on land as well as in water [D1533.1.1]. Three brothers attempt this task, but the older two are unkind to an old man (little man) who asks what they want to do. The third who answers honestly gets help from the old man and is then able to build the ship (in one night) [N825.2]. The old man also tells him to take with him anyone whom he meets. These turn out to be men with unusual abilities [F601]. See Type 513A. When the young man brings the ship, the king is amazed, but since the young man is of humble origin, he gives him further (difficult) tasks to prevent the marriage. The young man accomplishes them all with the help of his companions [F601.2] (see Type 513A) and marries the princess [L161]."
2167,514,The Shift of Sex,"A king who has only (three) daughters must send a son to war (needs a son for other reasons). The daughters ask to be allowed to pretend to be men, but only the youngest passes tests which her father sets. He gives her magic objects (a horse) and she goes to the war. In some variants a queen has only daughters and, afraid of her husbands anger, pretends that the youngest is a boy. Or for other reasons a woman disguises herself as a man and goes out into the world. The woman in mans clothing [K1837] accomplishes heroic deeds and/or goes into service with a king. The daughter (sister) of the king falls in love with her and wants to marry her. The woman in mans clothing refuses, or the marriage is unconsumated. In order to get rid of the servant/husband, impossible tasks are set. The woman is able to accomplish these with the help of a helper (several helpers, the horse). Cf. Types 461, 465, 513A513C. In some variants the tests concern the gender of the servant, which had been doubted. For example, her manner of eating and her behavior in a garden are tested, or she is asked to bathe with the brothers of the princess. At the end of the tale, the woman in mans clothing is transformed into a man. This happens either through a demons curse [D11] or a saints help, seldom by accident. Then the princess is happy with her husband and the former woman becomes king. Her parents are happy that finally they have a real son."
2168,514**,A Young Woman Disguised as a Man is Wooed by the Queen (previously The Court Physician),"(Including the previous Types 881* and 884A.) A young woman in mans clothing [K1837] works as a doctor [K1825.1.2] (messenger) for a king. The kings wife falls in love with the doctor but is repulsed (accuses him of attempting to seduce or rape her [K2111]). Angry, she sets an impossible task, which the doctor must perform on pain of death. Often it is to enable a dumb person to speak. The dumb person reveals the intention of the queen, who is executed. The king marries the young woman who had posed as a doctor. Cf. Types 880, 881, 881A, and 884."
2169,515,The Shepherd Boy,"A foundling child who herds animals finds three objects (of glass) which he gives back to their owners. They promise to reward him [Q42]. With the help of the last owner, a giant, the boy fulfills three tasks. He acquires a castle in which a princess is confined. He rescues her and marries her [L161]."
2170,516,Faithful John,"A prince wants to marry a beautiful princess from a distant land because he heard her name, saw her picture [T11.2, T11.2.1], or saw her in a dream [T11.3]. A faithful servant (adoptive brother, a dead man whom he has redeemed [P361, P311, P273.1]) helps him in this pursuit. The servant poses as a merchant and traps the princess on a ship [K1332], or he enters her room by hiding in a statue of an animal [K1341] (in a magical manner). The princess is kidnapped or goes voluntarily. Cf. Type 854. On the way back, the helper overhears creatures (birds [B211.3, B143]) [N451] prophesy the future. They say that certain dangers that threaten the bridal couple can be averted by particular actions, but also that anyone who reveals this will be turned to stone. The dangers are a horse (other animal) that will run away with (kill) the bridegroom, poisoned food [H1515] (drink, clothing [H1516]), and a dragon who will kill the bridegroom on his wedding night [T172.2]. When the helper acts to avert the dangers, his actions appear excessive and irrational. When he kills the dragon, drops of its blood fall on the brides breast. He removes them (with his mouth, or he sucks them out of her body while she is unconscious). The prince construes this as a sexual attack and condemns the helper to death [N342.1]. Before the sentence can be carried out, he justifies himself [C423.4] and is turned to stone step by step [C961.2]. The prince and his wife mourn the helper. The prince discovers (in a dream) that he can bring his friend back to life by sacrificing his own children. He kills (injures) them and rubs the stone man with their blood [E113, D766.2, S268]. The helper is restored to life and he revives the children. Cf. Types 505, 507, and 916."
2171,516C,Amicus and Amelius (previously St,"James of Galicia). Two friends who look exactly alike assist each other in time of need. When one of them, in elder versions named Amelius, is challenged to a swordfight, the other, Amicus, who is a better swordsman, takes his place. Amelius remains behind with Amicuss wife, and puts a sword in the middle of the marriage bed at night [T351]. Amicus wins the fight for his friend. Later, Amicus contracts leprosy. An angel tells them that he will be healed if he bathes in the blood of Ameliuss children. Amelius cuts off their heads to save his friend [S268]. The children are restored to life. Or, because his mother had made a vow before his birth, a young man goes on a pilgrimage. He meets a friend through an apple test: a true friend is one who, when he shares an apple, takes the smaller half [H1558.0.1.1] (who notices that an apple is missing). When the friend is killed (very ill) and can be cured only by the blood of the children of the young man, he sacrifices his children in order to save his friend [S268]. The children are later restored to life. Cf. Types 303, 516."
2172,517,The Boy who Understands the Language of Birds (previously The Boy who Learned Many Things),"A boy who understands (has learned) the language of birds [B215.1, B216] is asked by his father to tell what he has heard. He is at first reluctant, but then repeats the birds prophecy [B143, M312.0.2] that the father will humble himself before the son (will serve him, bring water for the son to wash his hands). The father pushes the son into the sea (drives him out, tries to kill him) [M373]. The son is rescued and goes into the service of a foreign ruler. By hearing what birds say, he frees this ruler from ravens that annoy him. The son is honored and is given half the kingdom, and he marries a princess. In his new high position, he goes back to his parents, who serve him without recognizing him [N682]. Cf. Types 671, 671E*, 725, and 781."
2173,518,Men Fight over Magic Objects (previously Devils [Giants] Fight over Magic Objects),"A (young) man on a journey meets three (two) men (giants, devils), who are quarreling over the division of three magic objects (e.g. cloak of invisibility, seven mile boots, wishing hat, flying carpet) (which they have inherited). The man promises to render a judgment, but he asks first to try out the objects (to run a race against the owners). He takes the magic objects and runs away with them. He uses them later to accomplish difficult tasks [D832]."
2174,519,The Strong Woman as Bride (Brunhilde),"A prince falls in love with a powerful young woman who will marry only someone whose own power is as strong as hers. Suitors who try and fail are put to death. Although he is warned against it, the prince sets out along with a strong companion to win her [T58]. When they arrive, the helper storms the womans defenses, slays her army, and overcomes the woman herself on his masters behalf [Z3]. He defeats her in single combat (using a cloak of invisibility): e.g. in a shooting contest with a giant bow [H345.1], in breaking her wild horse [H345.2] [F601.2, H345]. On the wedding night the strong woman tries to crush the prince [T173.1]. The helper secretly takes his masters place and beats her for three nights with whips made of three kinds of metal [K1844.1]. When the woman discovers the impersonation, she orders the feet of the helper to be cut off [Q451.2, S162] and banishes the prince to the pigsty [K1816.6]. The helper finds a blind companion and together they force a demon to heal them with Water of Life [D1500.1.18]. The helper returns, overcomes (kills) the strong woman, and rescues the prince [R169.4]. 530559 Animals as Helpers"
2175,530,The Princess on the Glass Mountain,"(Including the previous Type 530B*.) A narrative in three parts with several different forms and combinations: (1) At night, a field (haystack, garden) belonging to a family with three sons is robbed (devastated). The sons keep watch. The elder two fall asleep (run away in fear), but the youngest (helped by a mouse, frog, old man) stays awake and captures three magic horses [H1471]. They promise to help him in the future, and he lets them go free [B315, B401, B181]. Or, hiding in a mound of hay, he is carried home by a giant. He kills the giant and finds his treasure (helpful spirits) and three horses [B315, B401, B181]. In some variants a dying father orders his sons to watch over his grave. Out of indifference (fear), the older brothers leave this task to the youngest [H1462]. At the grave he receives three horses, as well as a pipe (stick, bridle) to use to summon them. (2) The kings daughter is offered in marriage to whoever can ride to the top of a mountain (made of glass, crystal, marble) [F751, H331.1.1, H331.1.2] and/or take a golden apple from its summit. Or he must kiss the princess at the summit and take her ring or scarf [R111.2.2] In some variants he must jump up to the princess who sits at the window of the fourth story of a building [F1071] (and take her ring), or jump over a grave [F989.1, H331.1.3, H331.1.4]. The young man disguises himself and, with the help of the magic horses, succeeds three times. On the third time, the king (princess) gives him a token (marks him, he is injured). He goes away. (3) Messengers (king, princess) look for the champion, and/or all the men are ordered to march past the princess (the princess summons all the men to a feast). Through his token (mark, injury), the youth is discovered at home (in the kings household) [H80]. He marries the princess. In some variants the horses are disenchanted and become princes (princesses). Cf. Types 313, 314, 314A."
2176,530A,The Pig with the Golden Bristles,"A king commands his (three) sons-in-law to get magic animals: a pig with golden bristles, a golden-horned stag, wild boars from the sea, etc. The stupidest of the sons (another foolish boy) gets these wonders, but trades them to his brothers in return for their cut-off fingers and pieces of skin from their backs. At the feast where the brothers are honored, they are exposed as cheaters by the pieces of evidence shown by the fool."
2177,531,The Clever Horse (previously Ferdinand the True and Ferdinand the False),"(Including the previous Type 513C.) This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with a clever horse. The tale exists chiefly in three different forms, The Godchild of the King und the Unfaithful Companion, The Golden-haired Maiden, and The Clever Horse. A poor boy goes in search of his godfather [H1381.2.2.1], the king (God, Virgin Mary, etc.) [N811]. On the way he obtains a clever magic horse that offers to help him [B211.1.3, B133, B401]. Against the horses advice [B341] he picks up a glimmering feather (golden hair, golden horse-shoe, other bright object), which he later gives to the king. En route the boy is accompanied by a companion (devil, beardless man, Gypsy, etc.) who forces him to change places [K1934] and to swear silence. At the kings court the boy is employed as a groom. He helps different animals, who in return promise to help him [B350, B391, B470, B501]. A treacherous employee of the king (the boys companion) slanders him to the king, saying that he had boasted he could find the bird that had lost the feather and/or to bring the golden-haired maiden (princess) as bride for the king [T11.4.1, H75.2, H1213.1, H1381.3.1.1]. On pain of death he is assigned to accomplish the dangerous tasks [H911]. He succeeds with help of his horse. The abducted princess refuses to marry the old king until she receives certain things (her castle, keys that have fallen into the sea, water of life, etc.). The boy brings these with the help of his horse and of the helpers he had met on his way (grateful animals) [H982, B450]. As the last condition for the marriage the princess demands the boy be killed (burned, beheaded, dismembered, by taking a bath in boiling milk or oil of a herd of wild mares, by water of death, etc.) The horse saves the boy or he is resuscitated by the princess, rejuvenated, and beautified [E15.1, E12, D1865.1]. The king has the same thing done to him with fatal results (the princess does not resuscitate him, he dies in the milk, etc.) [J2411.1]. The magic horse turns into a young woman (man) [B313, D131, D700]. The boy marries her (the princess) and becomes king. Cf. Type 328."
2178,532*,The Magic Ox (previously Son of the Cow ),"(Gods Godson.) With the help of a (two, several) magic ox (cow), a boy plows the copper (iron, stone) field of the king. He marries the princess and receives (half of) the kingdom."
2179,533,The Speaking Horsehead,"A princess is sent to her fianc, a prince of a foreign country. Her mother orders a maidservant to accompany her, and gives her a small rag with some drops of her mothers blood to protect her and sends a speaking horse to take care of her. When during the journey the princess loses her mothers charm, the waiting-maid gains control of the princess [K2252, K1911.1.1], forces her to change clothes and roles [K1934], and to swear an oath of secrecy [K1933]. The prince unwittingly marries the maidservant, and the real princess is employed as a goose-girl [K1816.5]. When the false wife orders the horse to be killed [B335], the princess persuades a farmhand to hang the horsehead on the wall by a gate where she passes daily. Every day she greets the horsehead with a formula, and it answers regretting the injury that is being done to her [D1011, B133.3]. When she speaks a magic formula to make the hat of a goose-boy fly away (to keep an obstrusive goose-boy away from her), he complains to the king. Thereupon the old king starts observing her and finally makes her tell her life story to a stove [H13.2.7] (her dog [H13.1.2]) (cf. Types 870, 894). The truth comes to light, the real bride marries the prince, and the maidservant is punished (she unwittingly declares her own judgment). Cf. Types 403, 425A."
2180,535,The Boy Adopted by Tigers (Animals),A boy is abandoned in the forest and adopted by wild animals (tigers). He is given a magic bow and a magic arrow (axe). The animals arrange a marriage for him. A monkey (barber) takes his place. The boy goes to live with an old widow who has a lovely daughter. He proves his identity by using his magic objects. He marries both the girl to whom he was betrothed and the widows daughter.
2181,537,The Flight on the Grateful Eagle (previously The Marvelous Eagle Gives the Hero a Box),"A man aims his gun three times at an eagle. When suddenly the bird speaks like a human being [B211.3], the man spares it. The eagle has a broken wing and the man nurses the bird for several years until it recovers, spending all his wealth. The grateful bird [B380, Q45] carries the man on his back across the sea [B552] to his kingdom [B222]. On the way it frightens him three times by nearly dropping him into the sea (as the hunter had aimed three times at the bird). On the other side of the sea the eagles father (sister) gives the man a box [D1174.1], telling him not to open it before he reaches home [C321]. Overcome with curiosity, the man opens the box on the way, and a town (castle) springs out of it. In order to put the town back into the box, the man promises his (unborn) son to the devil (supernatural being) [S222]. The tale is usually an introduction to Type 313B."
2182,540,The Dog and the Sailor (previously The Dog in the Sea),"An unhappy sailor in misery tries to drown himself, but in the water (on shore) he meets a dog (poodle) who offers its help [B541.4]. On the dogs advice he takes it along with him to sea. After three heavy storms (several years) the dog orders the sailor to jump into the water. At the bottom of the sea he finds a castle and a beautiful woman. The dog had warned him of her seductive powers, so he kills her. Inside the castle the dog is waiting for him. After enduring three painful nights (after accomplishing special tasks), the sailor cuts off the dogs head, whereupon the prince who had once been enchanted by his mother-in-law (witch, father) is disenchanted [D711] and returns to human form."
2183,545,The Cat as Helper,This type refers to a cycle of related tales; it combines episodes from types 545A and 545B.
2184,545A,The Cat Castle,"A poor girl reaches the kings castle with the help of a cat (dog) [B211.1.8, B422, B421, B435.1, B581.1.2], (her sole inheritance [N411.1.1]). On the cats advice she pretends to be the princess of the castle of the cats. The prince falls in love with her (the royal couple receives her). When she looks out of the window and sees her parents quarreling of a pot of porridge, she laughs. Being asked why, she does not want to reveal her humble origin, so she pretends to have been laughing at the poor condition of the kings castle. The girls noble origin is tested. When she says she possesses a castle more beautiful than that of the king, she is asked to show it. The cat goes to the castle of a troll (giant, giantess) [F771.4.1] and kills him (by making him look into the sun). The girl becomes the owner of the castle and marries the king (guests are received: The cat demands to be killed by the girl and turns into a prince [D711]. He marries the girl) [B582.1.2]. Cf. Type 505."
2185,545A*,The Magic Castle,"(Including the previous Type 512*.) A poor girl gives all her food to an animal (cat, dog, fox) or to an old beggar (Christ). Afraid that her grandmother (mother, aunt) will punish her, she runs away and comes to a castle. (On the way, supernatural beings transform her adornments from flowers, snail shells, etc. into precious jewels.) She becomes queen. The grandmother comes and demands the food that she had given away. But the grandmother is pushed off the balcony (ladder), dies, and turns into a grapevine (tree), which continues to question the queen about the missing food. The queen laughs at this and her husband demands that she should explain why she laughed. She replies hastily that the toilet brush is more beautiful than his beard (her own castle or garment is more beautiful than his). The animal (supernatural being) helps her to prove this by giving her a bejeweled toilet brush (castle). In some variants a girl is cast out by her older sisters. On the advice of an old man, she goes to work in a castle. When the owners son asks to see the girls own castle, the old man helps her to produce one. (Previously Type 512*.)"
2186,545B,Puss in Boots,"An animal (cat [B211.1.8, B422], fox [B435.1], jackal [B435.2], monkey [B441.1], etc.) intends to help a poor man (out of obligation) to become rich (by marrying him to the princess) [B580, B581, B582.1.1]. In order to gain the emperors confidence, the animal tells him that the poor man is very wealthy [K1917.3]. When the poorly dressed future bridegroom travels to his brides residence, the animal simulates an accident (robbery), in which all his clothes (horses, bride presents, wedding guests) are lost [K1952.1.1]. Thereupon the king gives the poor man good clothes and he is accepted as a bridegroom. When the man has to display his property, the animal leaves before him and coerces the shepherds and farmers to say that their herds and farmland belong to the poor man. The animal kills the real owner of the properties, a demon (dragon, ogre, giant, witch, magician) by burning, slaying, shooting or through a trick [F771.4.1, K722]. When the bride arrives with her entourage, the bridegroom presents himself as the real owner of the property. The animal tests the gratitude of the poor man by feigning death (it becomes a human when it is decapitated [D711]). In some variants the man behaves ungrateful or does not keep his promise."
2187,545D*,The Pea King (previously The Bean King),"(Including the previous Type 545C*.) A poor boy finds a pea (bean) and imagines how many peas might grow from it. He goes to the king and asks for storehouses and sacks for his coming crops. The king is impressed and believes the boy is. He tests his noble origin by a bed-test (cf. Type 704). The boy is unable to sleep on the hard couch because he is worried about his lost pea. He marries the kings daughter. When the king wants to see the property of his son-in-law, the young man meets an ogre (devil, grateful ghost) who offers to give him his castle, but only if he can solve some riddles. The ogre tells all the farmers and shepherds on the way to pretend to be employees of the poor boy. An old man helps him solve the riddles. The ogre and his brothers burst, and the poor man becomes the owner of the castle and its land. Cf. Type 859."
2188,546,The Clever Parrot,The king wins the gratitude of a parrot who takes him to a princess (the parrot brings a princess to the king). On the return trip the king and his bride are separated. The parrot reunites them.
2189,550,"Bird, Horse and Princess (previously Search for the Golden Bird)","The type combines two different introductory episodes with a common main part. Introductory episodes: (1) Every night an unknown thief steals a golden apple [F813.1.1] from the kings tree. The two elder princes fall asleep when they watch for the thief, but the youngest is successful. He sees a golden bird [B102.1] and shoots one of its colored (golden) feathers [H1471]. (2) A sick king can only be healed by the singing of a golden bird. He orders a search for it [H1210.1, H1331.1, H1213, H1331.1.2, H1331.1.3]. Main part: The three brothers go on a quest for the golden bird. The first two meet a fox (wolf) which they intend to shoot. The fox warns them against going to a pleasant inn in the village, but they go there nevertheless. Both of them forget their father and the bird. The youngest son is kind to the fox, follows its advice, and finds the golden bird [L13, B313, B560, H1233.6]. Against the foxs advice he also takes its golden cage and thus wakes the guards. In order to save his life he has to go on a quest for a golden (magic) horse [B184.1]. Again, he also takes its golden bridle, so its guards awake, and he is condemned to death unless he brings a golden maiden (princess) [D961, N711.3, H1241, H1239.3]. With the foxs help [B435.1] he succeeds and finally reaches home with the golden princess, the golden horse, and the golden bird [H1242]. Against the foxs advice he releases his brothers from the gallows. They steal the bird, the horse, and the princess, and try to kill the youngest brother [W154.12.3]. They pretend to their father that they have brought him the valuable things [K1932]. The fox saves the life of the youngest brother (by using water of life). The golden bird, the horse, and the princess identify him as the man who rescued them. (He marries the princess [L161]) and his brothers are punished.) In some variants the king is healed by the birds singing. Cf. Type 551."
2190,551,Water of Life (previously The Sons on a Quest for a Wonderful Remedy for their Father),"A sick king can only be healed by a wonderful remedy [H1324, D1500.1.18] (water of life [H1321.2], rejuvenating apples, phoenix bird [H1331.1], etc.). Whoever brings it [H1210.1] will inherit the kingdom. His three sons go on a quest. The two elder haughty ones are diverted from their goal. The youngest is single-minded and friendly towards old men (dwarf, eagle) who show him the way and give advice. With their help he reaches a magic castle that opens only for one hour. He appeases the animal guards (dragon, etc.) and finds everyone else asleep. He locates the fountain of life (golden apple tree) and takes the remedy [H1242]. He sleeps with a beautiful woman (princess) [N711.3, T475.2] and leaves his name (identification token) with her [H81.1]. When he leaves the castle it closes (sinks). On his way back he rejuvenates (releases) the helpful old men and receives magic objects in return. At home his unsuccessful brothers secretly exchange a common (poisoned) remedy for his healing one [K2211, W154.12.3]. They give it to the king [K1932] and he recovers. These brothers slander the youngest and the king orders him to be killed. With the help of his magic objects he is able to escape this sentence. Meanwhile the beautiful woman in the magic castle has given birth to a boy and has discovered the name of the intruder. She arrives at the head of an army and demands the father of her son [H1381.2.1]. The haughty brothers pretend it is they. They accompany her, riding beside the golden cloth (path) which the princess has spread, but they find that the gate at its end is closed. The youngest brother appears in rags, rides down the middle of the golden cloth toward the castle (is recognized by his tokens), and the gate opens for him. He marries the woman [L161] and becomes the ruler of the kingdom. The old king learns what really happened."
2191,552,The Girls Who Married Animals,"(Including the previous Types 552A and 552B.) This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) Following the wish of his dead father and against his brothers advice, the youngest son marries his three sisters to the first suitors who come for them [S221.1]. The suitors take the girls home with them [B620.1, B640]. On a quest for his sisters, the brother reaches the castles of his brothers-in-law and learns that they are the masters of the three animal kingdoms (men transformed to animals [D620, D621.1]; cf. Type 302C*). They receive their brother-in-law in a friendly way and provide him with magic means (parts of their body, feathers, hair, etc.) [B501, B505.1] to use to call them at any time (he leaves a signal of distress). With their help he accomplishes difficult tasks and finally marries a woman (princess). (He is dismembered by an ogre, summons the brothers-in-law, and they resuscitate him; cf. Type 302C*. They also recover his lost castle; cf. Type 560). (Previously Type 552A.) (2) Three girls who despair of being married say that they will marry any one even if the suitors are animals [C26]. Three animals pass by and take along the three girls as wives. When the girls father visits his daughters, he finds food and other things magically provided by the brothers-in-law [D2105]. Later (at home) he tries the same method without success [J2411.3] (his effort nearly ends tragically). (Previously Type 552B.)"
2192,554,The Grateful Animals,"(Including the previous Types 553, 554*, 554A*C*, and 556A*E*.) This miscellaneous type comprises various tales dealing with helpful deeds of grateful animals. In numerous tales the type occurs only as episode. Most of the variants present the following basic structure: A man while travelling meets three animals (from air, water and earth) who are in trouble. Because he rescues them, they promise to help him if needed. Later he falls in love with a princess whose father sets three impossible tasks for him to accomplish. With the help of the grateful animals he succeeds on three successive days [B582.2, H982, B571] and wins the princess. In some variants a part is added in which the man accompanies his elder brothers. When they try to injure some animals, he prevents them from doing so or compensates for their misdeeds and carelessness. When they trample on an ant-hill, he builds it up again, when they leave wounded animals, he takes care of them, etc."
2193,555,The Fisherman and his Wife,"A poor old fisherman rescues a supernatural being (magic fish [B170], other animal, divine being, saint, ogre, man in form of animal) from distress (danger of death, imprisonment, transformation). Or the fisherman puts a fish back into the water [B375.1]. In return the magic being grants him (and his wife) that all his wishes will be fulfilled [D1761.0.1]. In the beginning they profit only moderately, but later the wife becomes excessively demanding (e.g. they wish to become noblemen, kings, and finally even God himself). The fish (spirit) takes back his gift and the couple is returned to their former poor condition or punished in addition [C773.1, J514, Q338, L420] (transformed to animals)."
2194,556F*,The Shepherd in the Service of a Witch,"A father sends one of his three sons to tend the cattle (sheep, etc.) of a landlord who is a soothsayer (prince of sun, witch). When the boy drives the cattle to pasture, they suddenly disappear (in the forest, crossing a brook). He cannot follow them because he is confined in a tree (by a supernatural woman). After a while the cattle return, but he does not know where they have been or what they have eaten. Consequently he has not accomplished his task (and is punished). Then his brother tries, but he also loses the cattle. When the youngest brother tends the cattle, he succeeds with the help of the animals (the woman who had caught his brothers in the tree). By following the cattle, he learns that they transform themselves to women (daughters of the witch) during their absence. So he has accomplished his task [H1199.12.2]."
2195,559,Dungbeetle,"A (stupid, poor) boy (farmers son, smith, soldier, old man) buys various animals with special qualities (from a supernatural being): a mouse (rat), a (dung-) beetle, and a crayfish (ant, bee, cricket, louse, flea, lizard). Or he meets (finds) the animals on his way and takes them along. The king promises his melancholy daughter to any man who can make her laugh [T68, F591, H341, H1194]. The boy accomplishes this by means of the amusing actions of his animals (dancing, playing music) [H982, B571, B582.2]. But he is not accepted as a bridegroom and is thrown into a lions den. He is rescued by his animals, who also drive out the boys rival (prince) by their characteristic behaviors: The dungbeetle carries away the princes excrement [B482.2], the mouse makes him sneeze, etc. , or they torment him for three nights in such a way that he does not touch the princess but soils the bed instead. The king sends him away [T171] and the boy marries the princess [L161]. Cf. Types 571, 857."
2196,650A,Strong John,"A young man, born of an animal (son of a bear) or from a giant (troll-woman, forged from iron by a smith) [B631, F611.1.1, F611.1.11F611.1.15, T516] develops great strength (at the forge, in the forest, in war, by suckling for many years [F611.2.1, F611.2.3], by his great appetite, by tests of strength [F611.3.1], etc.). Because of his enormous appetite he is sent away from home [F612.1, F614.1]. He works for a smith but (often) injures his master [K1411, K1421, K1422], who tries to get rid of him by setting trials of strength [H931, F514.2, F612.3.1, F614.6]. The strong man has to uproot trees, to catch wolves and bears (lions, etc.), to tame devils, etc. [F613F613.4]. When he is sent to catch wild animals [F615.2.3], he harnesses them to a coach. When he is in a well and a mill stone (bell) is thrown on him, he wears it as collar or complains that chickens are scratching dirt onto him [F615.3.1, F615.3.1.1]. When he is sent to the devils mill (hell), he drives the devil to his masters house [F80, F615.1, H1272]. When he goes to the king to be paid, the king shoots him (in vain) with cannons. The strong man accomplishes every task and overcomes all difficulties [F615] (kills his master and finally marries)."
2197,650B,The Quest for a Strong Companion,"A young man seeks a strong adversary to wrestle with. He stays overnight in a hut where two strong men live. When he discovers them, he secretly runs away. In his flight he meets a giant plowman and begs him to conceal him from the strong men in pursuit. The giant plowman hides the young man in his trousers (pocket) [F531.5.11], and fights the two men [J2631]."
2198,650C,The Youth who Bathed himself in the Blood of a Dragon,"(Siegfried of the Nibelungenlied). A strong young man slays a dragon and bathes himself in its blood. Thereafter he has a tough skin which no weapon can penetrate [D1846.4.]. He dies from a wound in the only vulnerable spot on his body his armpit, which the dragons blood has not touched."
2199,652,The Prince whose Wishes Always Come True,"A godfather (God, Christ, beggar, soldier, Virgin Mary, etc.) gives a prince the power to make all his wishes come true [N811, D1761.0.1]. An envious person (servant, gardener, cook, smith, general, dwarf, court jester, etc. [K2250]) learns about the princes extraordinary ability, and kidnaps the boy. The servant smears blood on the queens mouth [K2155.1] (clothes), so she is accused of killing and eating her son, and is imprisoned [Q455]. The prince is rescued and reared by foster-parents (woodsman [R131.8.5, N856.1]). The kidnapper uses the princes magic power by telling him to wish for riches (castle). Later the prince falls in love with his foster-parents daughter (a playmate he had wished for [T52.1]), who tells him of his true identity. The prince transforms his kidnapper into a dog [D141] and his sweetheart into a carnation [D212.1] (lily, rose) and goes with them to his fathers court where he takes service as a huntsman. He identifies himself to his father. The queen is released and the malefactor is punished. The prince restores his sweetheart to human form and marries her [D630, D711.4, H151.7, L162, S451]."
2200,653,The Four Skillful Brothers,"(Including the previous Type 513C*.) Three (four [P251.6.2] or more) brothers leave home and acquire extraordinary skills [F660.1]. The first is a huntsman, the second a ship-builder (astronomer), the third a thief (the fourth a tailor). When they return home they demonstrate their skills to their father [F642, F642.1, F661.1.1, F661.4, F662.1, H504, H1151.12, K305.1]. They all help to rescue a princess who was captured by a dragon [R166, R111.1.3]: The ship-builder builds a fast ship to carry them to the island where the princess is imprisoned (the astronomer discovers the place of her imprisonment), the thief steals her, and the huntsman shoots the dragon (the tailor sews the ship destroyed by the dragon back together [F662.2]). Later each of the brothers claims that he should marry the princess [H621.2, R111.7]. In some variants either their dispute remains unresolved [Z16], or the brothers father marries the princess. She may decide herself whom to marry. Sometimes it is proposed that she should be divided, and only her true lover objects (Solomons judgment, cf. Type 926). Or, the winning suitor is decided by lot, or the brothers are given money or half the kingdom instead [Q112]."
2201,653A,The Rarest Thing in the World,"A princess is offered to whichever of three suitors (friends, brothers) brings the best (rarest, most precious) thing in the world [T68.1] (three men with extraordinary abilities woo the princess). They acquire wonderful (magic) objects: a mirror (telescope, spectacles) which shows everything that is happening in the world [D1323.15], a flying coat (flying carpet) [D1520.18, D1520.19] and a fruit (apple, lemon, etc.) or an ointment that heals (resuscitates) [D1500.1.5.1, E106]. When they meet they use the telescope to see that the princess is sick (dead). They go to her immediately with the carpet and use the fruit to heal her (restore her to life). A dispute follows as to who is to marry her [H621.2, Z16]. (She chooses the one who loves her most.)"
2202,653B,The Suitors Restore the Maiden to Life,"A woman loved by three (four) suitors dies [T92.0.1]. The first keeps watch at her funeral pyre, the second takes her ashes to the river (Ganges), the third (a wandering beggar) learns a magic formula that restores her to life [T92.14]. A dispute follows as to who is to marry her [H621.2, Z16]. Usually the problem is solved in a philosophic explanation: The one who brought the woman back to life is like her father; the one who carried her ashes to the river is like her son; the one who watched the funeral pyre is like her husband and therefore may marry her."
2203,654,The Three Agile Brothers,"Three brothers are sent out by their father to acquire skills. The one who learns best will inherit the house [F660.1, H504]. The first becomes a smith, the second a barber, the third a fencer. When they are asked to demonstrate their skills, the smith shoes a horse while it is galloping [F663.1], the barber shaves a running hare [F665.1], the fencer circulates his sword so fast that he stays dry in a heavy rain [F667.1]. The father either choses one of his sons, or, he leaves his property to all three of them."
2204,655,The Wise Brothers,"(Including the previous Type 655A). A father leaves his wealth to his three sons. One of them steals diamonds (pieces of gold) that had been willed to all three brothers. In order to settle the case they consult a wise man. On their way they see tracks of an animal and make the following deductions [J1661.1]: It was a camel (horse, pack-animal), it was one-eyed (grass is eaten on one side of the road only) [J1661.1.1], it was lame (because of its tracks), it was carrying oil or honey, etc. (drops are seen on the ground), it had no tail (dung on a heap instead of being spread by the tail), etc. When they meet the owner of the lost animal he overhears their remarks, takes them for thieves, and brings them to the judge. They explain their observations to the judge and are absolved. When they are invited for dinner (by the judge) they say the meat is dogmeat [F647.5.1], the wine (bread) smells like a corpse [F647.1], and their host is a bastard [J1661.1.2]. On investigation all their statements are found to be true. The animal had been suckled by a bitch, the vine (corn) had grown on a cemetery, and the mother (of the judge) confesses her adultery. In some variants the judge tells the story of the noblest act (cf. Type 976) in order to settle the dispute of the inheritance. Based on his reaction he declares the youngest to be the thief. Or, the brothers are asked to shoot on their fathers corpse, so that their behavior discloses the real son and heir (cf. Type 920C). In other versions the judge enforces another test of paternity [H486.1], or he pronounces another of Solomons judgments."
2205,660,The Three Doctors,"Three doctors display their skills [H504]. One removes one of his eyes, the second one his hand (arm, finger) and the third his stomach (heart), intending to replace it later [F668.1]. During the night a cat eats the body parts. A servant substitutes the eye of a cat [E781.3], the hand of a thief [E782.1.1] and the stomach of a hog [E787] (heart [E786]), and the doctors replace them without injury [E780.2, E782]. The one with the cats eye can see best at night (always looks for mice), the one with the thiefs hand steals, and the one with the hogs stomach is always hungry (sniffs and roots at the ground)."
2206,664*,The Soldier Hypnotizes the Innkeeper,"(Including the previous Types 664A* and 664B*.) This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A soldier (passer-by) in an inn pays with pieces of gold that turn out to be buttons (small bones). When the innkeeper takes the soldier to court, the soldier hypnotizes the judge so that he thinks a flood is occuring. He is forced to go through a series of adventures without leaving the room. Returning to his senses, the judge acquits the soldier. (Previously Type 664A*.) (2) A soldier tells tales and by his magic power makes an innkeeper believe that he is a bear, that the soldier is a wolf, and that they are being chased by dogs, etc. The innkeeper falls out of his bed and comes to his senses. (Previously Type 664B*.)"
2207,665,The Man who Flew like a Bird and Swam like a Fish,"A man (youngest of three brothers, cheated heir) is given the power of transforming himself into animals of earth, air, and water [D630, D150, D170, D117.2] by an old man in return for his hospitality (construction of a bridge) [E341] or by grateful animals [B350] whom he had helped [Q42.1]. He goes into the service of a king who has departed for war and has forgotten an (two) important object (magic sword [D1081], magic ring [D1470.1.15], telescope, war documents, gloves). The king promises his daughter to whoever can deliver the forgotten object immediately. The soldier offers his help. He reaches the castle fast by swimming as a fish, flying as a bird, and running as a hare [D641]. He presents himself to the princess in his different transformations. She gives him the forgotten object and keeps a piece of his scale, pelt, a bit of fur, and a feather for herself. On his return the soldier is killed by an envious rival [K1931.3]. The murderer takes the forgotten object and claims the reward. When the princess asks to see a second demonstration of the transformations, the cheater fails. She refuses to marry him and her father threatens to execute her. The soldier, resuscitated by his magic helpers [B515], arrives at the last moment [N681], proves his identity (identification by feather [H78.2] and marries the princess. The cheater is condemned to death."
2208,666*,Hero and Leander,"During the feast of Adonis in Sestos, Leander sees Hero, a priestess of Aphrodite, falls in love with her at first sight, and wins her love. Hero has been consigned to celibacy, so the lovers can only meet secretly. Leander swims every night through the Hellespont strait to see Hero who shines a light from the tower for him. One stormy night the light goes out and Leander is drowned. Hero sees his body and plunges into the sea to be united with him in death [T83]."
2209,667,The Wood Spirits Foster-Son,"A boy, who had been promised by his father in a crisis to a wood spirit (demon, drakos) [F440], receives from the latter the power to transform himself into various animals [D630.1]. He frees a princess who had been kidnapped by the demon, and is thrown into the sea [S142] by a treacherous nobleman who claims to have rescued the princess [K1932, K1935]. The cheater is exposed, and the boy marries the princess."
2210,670,The Man who Understands Animal Languages (previously The Animal Languages),"A grateful snake gives a man the power to understand animal languages [B350, B491.1, B165.1, B216], and tells him that if he reveals the secret, he must die [C425]. Once the man hears animals talking and laughs. His curious wife insists on knowing why he does so [N456]. Worn down by her nagging, he is about to give in and tell her [T253.1]. Then he hears a rooster say how easily he rules his many wives, while the man cannot rule even his one wife [N451, B469.5, T252.2]. The man keeps his secret and does not tell her anything. Cf. Types 517, 671, and 673."
2211,670A,The Woman who Understands Animal Languages,"A newly married woman who knows animal languages hears jackals (other animals) saying that a corpse floating in the river has a valuable ring on its finger [N547]. She pulls the corpse from the river and removes the ring. (In order to remove the ring she has to bite off the finger. Her husband sees her, believes her to be a cannibal ogress [N342.6], and decides to return her to her family.) En route she overhears animals (birds) talking about where a treasure is hidden. Her husband learns the truth and they are reconciled. (The husband stays to guard the treasure and the wife goes to get her father-in-law. When he sees her returning alone, he concludes she has killed his son and is returning to kill him, and slays her before she has a chance to speak.) Cf. Types 178A178C."
2212,671,The Three Languages,"A young man learns the languages of dogs [B215.2], birds [B215.1], and frogs [B215.4]. His father, angry at such useless knowledge, drives him out and orders him to be killed. A compassionate servant lets him escape and substitutes an animals heart as proof for the murder [K512.2]. By means of his knowledge of the dogs language the boy discovers a treasure (he cures a sick princess and marries her later). Through his knowledge of the frogs language he learns that he will be elected pope [H171.2]. When he arrives in Rome, two doves come to sit on his shoulders and he is recognized as a man worthy of being pope (birds indicate his election as pope [H171.2]). The two doves tell him what to do so that he will be elected pope, and give him advice on how to act. Cf. Types 517, 725."
2213,671D*,To Die Next Day,"A farmer, overhearing the conversation of animals talking (during Christmas, New Years or Easter night), finds that he is to die (is warned of death) the next day (very soon). The prediction comes true. Cf. Type 930*."
2214,671E*,A Magic Boy,"A boy understands the language of birds and can interpret dreams. A merchant takes the boy in payment for goods and orders him to be slaughtered. He wants to eat the boys heart and liver in order to obtain his wisdom. The boy escapes. The merchant is called to the king to interpret a dream. He cannot do this. The boy arrives, interprets the dream, and exposes the merchant. Cf. Type 517."

(Previously Type 672B.) (3) A good-natured maidservant shares milk with a (sick) serpent (wearing a crown) [B765.6] (cf. Type 285) and is chased away by a farmer. When the maidservant marries a (rich) shepherd, the serpent, still grateful for the milk, appears at her wedding and lays down its crown of silver and gold [B112]. (Previously Type 672C.) Or, the serpent gives her its crown in return for her sharing her milk. Later, the maidservant, at her wedding, thanks the snake for its help and returns the crown."
2216,672B*,Expelling Snakes,"A sorcerer undertakes to expel snakes from a certain region. He succeeds in decoying the king of the snakes (white crowned snake), but dies from a snakebite (is carried off into the earth with the snakes)."
2217,672C*,Testimony of the Serpent,"(Including the previous Type 842B*). A woman who owns (is friendly with) a magic serpent is raped by a prince. The woman asks the serpent, who witnessed the act of violence, to testify that the prince should marry no one else. (A prince calls a serpent to witness that he will marry a farmwife.) When the prince is about to marry a beautiful princess, the serpent twists itself about his neck. The first woman comes and frees him from the serpent on the condition that he marries her.

2219,673,The White Serpents Flesh,"(Including the previous Types 671C* and 672D*.) Contrary to a warning, a servant (cook) eats the flesh of a white serpent (from the kings pot), whereupon he understands the speech of animals (birds) [B217.1.1] (cf. Types 670, 672 [1]). Or, a boy (driver) tastes the meat of a white snake that has been prepared by a healer (farmer), whereupon he understands the language of the grass and trees. (Previously Type 672D*.) When he is accused of stealing a ring this knowledge enables him to prove his innocence. By overhearing the conversation of ducks he learns that one of them has swallowed the queens ring that fell from the window [N451]. (Previously Type 671C*.) He orders the duck to be slaughtered, the ring is found, and he is saved. (He learns that the ring is in the stomach of a grateful fish, who brings it back [cf. Type 736A])."

2221,675,The Lazy Boy,"(Including the previous Type 675*). A lazy stupid boy [L114.1] releases a fish (frog, serpent, supernatural being), which gives him the power of making all his wishes come true [B375.1, D1761.0.1]. The lazy boy then makes an axe cut trees itself [D1601], water carry itself, a wagon move itself [D1523.1], an oven carry him, etc. When the princess laughs at him, he wishes her pregnant [T513] (from eating an apple, etc.). She does not know the father of her beautiful child. The king orders a test of paternity [H486], and the child picks the lazy boy out as father [H481] (by handing him an apple [H481.1], ball, golden ball). The king orders father and mother (and child) to be abandoned in a cask in the sea [S141] (in the mountains [S147]). By the power of wishing they reach land. The young man wishes to be beautified and makes a castle appear next to the kings [D1131.1]. When the king comes to visit, the young man wishes that an object (golden apple, golden cup) would appear in his pocket [L175]. The king is accused of stealing. Thus he is shown that the appearance of guilt and innocence (unwitting pregnancy, unwitting theft) is often deceptive."
2222,677,Iron Is More Precious than Gold,"An unlucky man asks his king for advice about what he should do. The princess advises him to marry because the luck of his wife (children) could counteract his own bad luck. The king allows him to marry the princess. When she sends him out to sell her needlework, he trades it for (threefold) pieces of good advice. He does not dare to return home without any money and finds work on a ship. When the ship is becalmed, he is sent down to the bottom of the sea to repair it, and there he settles a quarrel between two spirits: What is more precious (more useful, harder): gold (diamond, silver, copper) or iron (steel, copper) He gives a (diplomatic) answer (following the first good advice). He receives a bag of (precious) stones as a reward and returns to the ship. Together with the merchants he reaches a strange country where the king favours him because of his jewels. The merchants are jealous and make a bet as to who is the richest of them. Following the second advice, he wins the wager and with it all the servants and the ship. He continues to travel and trades for 730 years. Finally he returns home and finds his wife sleeping between two strange men. When he is about to kill all three, he remembers the third piece of advice, to think before he acts. He finds that the men are his two grown-up sons. Cf. Type 910B."

2225,681,Relativity of Time (previously King in the Bath; Years of Experience in a Moment),"This miscellaneous type comprises various tales mostly from China and other east Asian areas, dealing with a ruler who learns about the relativity of time. In Chinese variants he experiences a long space of time in a moment by having a dream (sometimes caused by drugs), in Indian variants by putting his head under water, in other (often Asian) variants, the vision takes place by magic [D2012.1]. Cf. Type 471A."
2226,682,Meditation on the Trinity,"A man (philosopher, St. Augustine), meditating on the mystery of the Trinity, sees a child trying to empty the sea into a little hole at the shore. The child states that he could better bail out the sea with a thimble [H1113.1] than the man would be able to understand the secret of the Trinity. The child disappears."
2227,460A,The Journey to God (Fortune) (previously The Journey to God to Receive Reward),"(Including the previous Types 461A and 702A*.) A beggar wants to know why he is so poor. Or, a man has heard that God returns alms given away a thousand times [J1262.5.1]. This does not happen to him, so he goes to complain to God. On his journey to God (fortune, sun) the hero meets men, animals and objects that asks him (three) questions which he should ask God [H1291]: e.g. (1) a wolf (lion) asks why he is never full after eating (answer: he has to eat a stupid person), (2) a tree asks why it is so dry (answer: a treasure is buried under the roots), (3) a king asks why he cannot enlarge his kingdom by war (answer: she is a queen and she should marry), (4) some young women ask why they are not married (answer: they throw the dirt into the sun), (5) a fish asks why he is alone in a river (answer: he should drown or devour somebody), (6) a river wants to know why there is no life in it (answer: it should drown somebody). God answers the questions and on the homeward journey the traveler passes on the answers and is rewarded [H1292]. In some variants the traveler disclaims the rewards because God promised him wealth when he comes home. The wolf eats him up because the traveler is the most stupid person it ever met."
2228,460B,The Journey in Search of Fortune,"(Including the previous Types 947B* and 947C*.) Two brothers live together on their farm but only one of them does the work. This brother wants to divide the farm so he can run his part alone. He works harder than his brother but after a while he wonders why the farm of his lazy brother is more successful. He goes to find Fortune to ask her why [H1281]. On his way he meets things and people that give him questions, and he promises to ask Fortune for answers. When he arrives at Fortune he is told that he was born on an unlucky day. He sees that Fortune from day to day has less to eat. When her servants tell her how many people are born on that day she orders that they should have as much as she had on that day [N127.0.1]. On the homeward journey, the man answers the questions of the things and people he has met. Cf. Types 460A, 735. Sometimes he marries a lucky woman who brings him good luck. Later he gives someone who had asked him about the owner of the farm an untrue answer, and loses his luck. Cf. Type 737B*."
2229,461,Three Hairs from the Devils Beard,"A poor young man wants to marry the daughter of a king (rich man). Her father tries to get rid of the young man by sending him to the devil (ogre) to bring him three hairs of the devils beard [H1273.2]. On his way some objects and animals ask the young man to ask the devil some questions [H1291]. A well wants to know why it has dried up, a tree wants to know why it is withered and the ferryman who rows the hero to the devil wants to know when he will be replaced. With the help of the devils mother (grandmother, wife) [G530.1], who asks her son when she louses him or when he is asleep, the young man gets the three hairs and the answers to his questions [H1292]. The ferryman has to give the oar to someone else [Q521.5], the spring of the well is blocked by a frog [A1111], and the roots of the tree are damaged by a treasure (snake). For his answers and help the young man receives a large reward, and the king has to accept him as son-in-law. The greedy king also wants to get treasures on the way to the devil, but he becomes the replacement for the ferryman [P413.1.1]."
2230,462,The Outcast Queens and the Ogress Queen,"(Including the previous Type 302A.) A king with three (seven, nine) wives has no children, but his wives become pregnant by eating a pear. When he is hunting [G405] he meets an ogress in form of a beautiful young woman whom he wants to marry [G264, G369.1.5]. She demands that his wives shall be killed (thrown into a pit [S435]) and as proof she asks for their eyes [S438] (and their hearts). In the forest (a pit) the blinded outcast queens bear their children one after another, but because of their hunger they divide and eat them [G72.2]. Only the youngest queen saves her son [L71]. When the son grows up he takes care of the queens. The ogress queen recognizes him and tells him that he could get the eyes of the queens back if he does an errand for her. She gives him a Uriah letter and sends him to her mother [K511]. A helper changes the letter and the son is given the eyes, which he takes back to the queens. The king hears the truth and punishes the ogress queen."
2231,465,The Man Persecuted Because of his Beautiful Wife,"(Including the previous Types 465A465D.) A man marries a beautiful young woman of supernatural origin: She is an animal bride (e.g. swan maiden [B642]) or she comes from God. She secretly keeps house for him. He discovers her and steals or burns her animal skin to prevent her from turning back into an animal. An envious king coverts this beautiful wife and, on advice of an evil adviser (vizier, old woman) [H911], he gives the hero (three) impossible tasks to get rid of him [H931.1, H1211]: e.g. to build a castle or bridge in one night, to bring an exceptional baby (who understands 14 languages), to find a living harp [H1335], to harvest a field of grain in one night [H1090], to bring grapes in winter [H1023.3], to feed an army, to bring a huge tent that fits into one hand, to bring a very small (thumb-sized) man. The man accomplishes two of the tasks with the help of his wife [H1233.2.1]. The last task often leads him to the otherworld, and it is accomplished by one of the wifes relatives who defeats the king. In some variants the king finds out about the beautiful young woman from a picture [T11.2] that the hero carries with him. Cf. Types 313, 402, 471, and 531."
2232,467,The Quest for the Wonderful Flower (Jewel),"A young man finds a beautiful flower (jewel) and gives (sells) it to a king who demands more of them. The young man looks for the source and finds a princess who produces the flowers (jewels) magically out of her blood [D457.1.1, D457.1.3]. She had been kidnapped by an ogre, and the young man rescues her. Cf. Types 407, 465."
2233,470,Friends in Life and Death [M253],"Two friends promise each other to be guests at each others weddings. One of them dies but takes part invisibly in the wedding of the living friend. He invites him for a return visit [E238]. The living friend also takes part in the wedding of his friend in the otherworld. They take a long journey through the otherworld and see strange things: a broad and a narrow road to heaven and hell [F171.2], fat cattle in a poor pasture and lean cattle in a green one (formerly rich and poor people) [F171.1], people and animals who argue [F171.3], etc. When the living man returns he finds that he has been away many (three) centuries [D2011]. All is changed and he knows no one. He dies or turns to dust. Cf. Type 471."
2234,470A,The Offended Skull,"(Leontius, Don Juan, Festin de Pierre.) A drunken man finds a skull (statue, a dead man hanging on the gallows), kicks it, and invites it to dinner. The skull (dead person) visits the living person and warns him about his bad behavior (kills him). On a return visit, the living person is a guest in the otherworld [C13]. In some variants the living person watches things in the otherworld. In other variants the living person stays in the otherworld only for a short time, but finds that in this world a long time has passed and everything has changed [D2011]."
2235,470B,The Land where No One Dies [F116],"(Including the previous Type 470*.) A young man seeks for a land where no one dies. On his way to the otherworld he meets animals and men who do things for which they need a very long time (e.g. to clear away a mountain grain by grain), but they are not immortal. Finally he reaches the land where no one dies and lives there together with a young woman. When he longs for his home, the woman advises him against leaving. He insists on going, and she warns him not to touch the earth. He passes the people and animals which he had met on outward journey, but they have finished their work and died. Back home he meets a man with a carriage full of worn-cut shoes, and he gets off his horse to help the man. But it is death looking for him, and he dies."
2236,471,The Bridge to the Otherworld,"Three brothers one after the other set out to look for work, or to search for their lost sister [H1385.6] who is married to someone in the otherworld. They are given a difficult job: They must herd seven foals (oxen) and at the end of the day they must bring back a sample of the animals food [H1251] (other things). In some variants they have to accompany a supernatural being (sun, death) and are not allowed to talk or to be distracted. The elder brothers fail: They are lured away by a bird, or persuaded by an old woman to rest, or they fail to cross a certain bridge. They are transformed to stone [D231]. The youngest brother follows the instructions and passes across the bridge [F152, E481.2.1]. He sees visions [F171]: Fat cattle in a poor pasture and lean cattle in a green one [F171.1], stones striking on each other [F171.3], and animals which, passing in and out of a church, become human beings and take part in the Holy Communion [F171.5]. The boy takes bread and wine from the altar and brings it to the supernatural being. The visions are explained [F171.0.1]: the fat and lean cattle in the differend pastures fomerly were rich and poor people. The striking stones were people who argued and are forced to continue their conflicts in the otherworld. The animals in the church are angels, priests, or transformed princes. The youngest brother is rewarded and his brothers are disenchanted [R155.1, H1242]."
2237,471A,The Monk and the Bird,"A monk, thinking about the everlasting life in the monastery gardens, listens to the singing of a bird. He believes it lasts only a short moment but when he returns to the monastery he has grown old and nobody recognizes him because decades (three centuries) have gone by [D2011.1]. Cf. Type 681."
2238,475,The Man as Heater of Hells Kettle,"A poor soldier (servant) takes a job (for seven years) in hell [M210]. Or, parents wish that the devil will take their greedy child [M411.1]. The soldier has to heat the kettles and is not allowed to wash [C721.1] or comb himself. He is also not allowed to look into the pots [C325]. He breaks this rule and finds his former masters or unfriendly relatives in the kettles. He heats them even more. Or, he releases poor souls (transformed into animals). In payment he receives sweepings which later change into gold [D475.1]. Or, on the advice of a soul he has released, he asks for something worthless (an old piece of clothing) that gives money. The host at an inn where he stays for the night robs him of his gold [D861.1], but with the devils help he recovers it [cf. D885]. Cf. Types 332C*, 360, 361, and 563."
2239,476,Coal Turns into Gold,"This miscellaneous type consists of various tales (mostly legends) in which coal turns into gold (silver). Cf. Types 476*, 476**. E.g.: (1) A person finds (the devil gives him) some coal that turns into gold [D475.1.1]. In some variants the person has to throw a rosary (bridle) onto the coal to effect the transformation. (2) A person breaks apart glowing coals and finds a treasure under them [N532]. (3) The gold (transformed coal) brings unexpected good fortune to a poor person (child, charcoal burner, maidservant, shepherd, orphan). (4) A maidservant gets glowing coals for her kitchen fire. The next morning, she finds pieces of gold in the ashes [F342.1]. Her master takes the gold away from her. (5) A man who wants to smoke his pipe has no lighter. He takes a piece of coal from the fire, but his pipe will not light from it even on the third try. When he knocks out his pipe, a piece of gold falls out of it."
2240,476*,In the Frogs House,"A woman promises a frog to be friends and becomes midwife (godmother) to the frogs wife. She takes the frogs child to be christened, sweeps the dust in the frogs house, and takes the garbage home with her. There it becomes gold (money). In some variants she frees drowned souls or brings up the child of the frog for seven years and then is able to release its parents from enchantment. Cf. Types 156B*, 476, 476**."
2241,476**,Midwife in the Underworld,"Someone (an animal who turns into a supernatural being) summons a midwife to help a supernatural being (dwarf, water spirit, elf, forest spirit, human woman who has been kidnapped by fairies) give birth [B81.6, F372, F372.1, F451.5.5, F333]. As payment for her services, the midwife is given something apparently worthless (coal, leaves, garbage, onions, garlic), most of which she throws away carelessly. Later she finds that the small part she still has, has turned to gold [D475.1]. She looks for what she lost but cannot find it (the gift means danger of life). Cf. Types 476, 476*."
2242,480,The Kind and the Unkind Girls (previously The Spinning-Women by the Spring,"The Kind and the Unkind Girls) [Q2]. A girl is mistreated by her stepmother [S31] and has to work very hard [H934.3]. This tale exists chiefly in two different forms: (1) A girl loses an object which is carried off by a river (blown away by the wind), and runs after it (a spindle [N777.4]) [N777.2, N791]. She comes upon an old woman (ogress) who asks her to clean (disarrange) and to louse her head [H935, Q41.2, G466]. When the old woman lets her choose a box as her reward, she choses the plain one [L211]. (2) A girl falls into a well (is pushed in, jumps in after an object she has dropped [N777]), or follows a rolling cake (ball of yarn, etc. [H1226]). She encounters various animals, objects, or people who ask her for help: e.g. a cow wants to be milked, an old man or woman to be loused or fed, an oven to be emptied of bread, an apple tree to be shaken [D1658.1.5]. The girl helps them all. Then she arrives at the house of an old woman (Frau Holle, old man, supernatural beings like a giant or the twelve months) where she is assigned tasks [G204, H935]: e.g. she has to do the household or farm work, has to feed or louse the demon [G466], has to comb the hair of fairies [H1192], has to carry water in a sieve [H1023.2] or wash black wool white [H1023.6]. She is very helpful and hard-working. In the end she is is rewarded [Q41] with gold, jewels, etc. , becomes more beautiful [D1860], or jewels fall from her mouth [D1454.2]. Or, she can choose her reward and is very modest but the reward changes into wealth when she reaches home. In some variants she is forbidden to enter a certain room [C611]. When she breaks this rule, she becomes covered with gold and flees. The grateful animals [B350], objects [D1658], and people of her outward journey help her escape from the demon. After she arrives home, her envious stepmother sends her own daughter on the same journey. This girl goes through the same situations but she refuses help, disobeys, and is unkind. She is punished severely (frogs fall from her mouth [M431.2], horns grow on her head, or she is disfigured, beaten or killed). In some variants the stepmother is also punished. In the end the kind young woman often marries a prince. Cf. Types 431, 480A, and 1180."
2243,480A,Girl and Devil in a Strange House,"(Including the previous Type 1441.) A girl leaves home because of her cruel stepmother. On her way she helps some animals and takes them with her. During the night they stay in a strange house. A demon (devil) tries to enter (to dance with the girl, to marry her), but the girl refuses to open the door unless he gives her certain valurable gifts. When morning comes, the demon has not fulfilled all the wishes so he cannot enter the house. He loses his strength and goes away. This is often followed by account of the unfriendly stepsister who gives no help to the animals and is killed by the demon. Cf. Types 431, 480."
2244,480A*,Three Sisters Set out to Save their Little Brother,"A witch carries away the little brother of three sisters. The elder sisters set out to search him, but pay no attention to the requests of an apple-tree, an oven, etc. , and are overtaken by the witch. The third does all she is asked to do; therefore, the grateful objects help her to recover her little brother from the clutches of the witch. Cf. Type 480."
2245,480C*,Transporting White Bread to Hell,"A poor brother brings his wealthy brother a gift of coarse white bread (a lamb). The wealthy brother says, Go to hell with your bread. On his way to hell, the poor brother meets an old man who tells him what he has to do there. He saves many souls from hell and is rewarded by the old man. The wealthy brother also takes bread to hell, but is discourteous to the old man and gets no advice. He falls victim to the devils. Cf. Type 565."
2246,480D*,Tales of Kind and Unkind Girls,"(Including the previous Types 480* and 480B*.) This miscellaneous type consists of various tales in which an unkind girl (neighbor, wife) wants to have the same reward that a kind one received. However, she is too selfish and is punished instead."
2247,485,Borma Jarizhka,"(Including the previous Type 485A*.) The tsar sends a man to Babylon to get a crown. He steals the crown and burns the snakes that pursue him. He comes to an one-eyed giant, blinds him, and escapes from the cave under the belly of the giant. (Cf. Type 1137.) He begets a child with a wild woman, but when he leaves her she is so angry that she breaks the baby in two. He helps a lion who brings him home. In spite of the lions warning, he boasts of his journey while he is drunk. In justification he shows the lion the power of intoxication, and gets him drunk. Cf. Type 1137."
2248,485B*,The Power of Drunkenness,"(Including the previous Type 161B*.) The animal helper (bear, lion) of a man forbids him, on pain of death, to praise him. The man breaks this rule while he is drunk. In order to justify and save himself, he makes the animal drunk. While it is drunk the animal lets itself be bound. It acknowledges the power of hops and forgives the man."
